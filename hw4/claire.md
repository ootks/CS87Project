# Oulipian Meeting - Computational Literature
Claire Goeckner-Wald

### Compose a 3-word permutation poem.
It may or may not have all permutations, it may or may not have repetition of lines.

> KILL OUR PROCESS <br>
> PROCESS OUR KILL <br>
> OUR KILL PROCESS.

### Compose a Biku.
A 3-line poem where two lines are identical or almost identical.

> Textbook problems. <br>
> Textbook problems. <br>
> Caltech

### Compose a Haiku Biku.
Tom La Farge suggested the form of Haiku Biku, forcing a 5-7-5 syllable structure on Biku (so that the first and third line are ~identical).

> Our textbook problems <br>
> Stem from the textbook problems <br>
> But so we like it. <br>

### Rewrite this line in the form of a Haiku Biku
“You cannot step twice into the same river” said Heraklitus.

Biku:
> Step once. <br>
> Step twice. <br>
> New river.

Haiku Biku:
> Step in the river. <br>
> Step in the river once more. <br>
> Different water. 

### Compose An Oulipian Médaille
An Oulipian Medal (Médaille) is a poem in the form of Haiku, where the third line should be similar to the first line (yet not identical), however the last N syllables must be “scrambled”, that is occur in a different order (N>=2).

> She groaned to compliment him. <br>
> That was then. But now, <br>
> She's grown to complement him.

### Compose a poetic line 
Use the “structuralist” algorithm.

Original inspiration (from the lecture slides):
> The work you are holding in your hands represents, itself alone, a quantity of text far greater than everything man has written since the invention of writing, including popular novels, business letters, diplomatic correspondence, private mail, rough drafts thrown into the wastebasket, and graffiti.

Defamiliarize the structure:
> A work is held in your hand. Popular novels, business letters, diplomatic correspondence, private mail, rough drafts thrown into the wastebasket, and graffiti do not surpass it in size.

Increase poetic function: 
> That work held in your hand - <br>
> Popular novels, business coast-to-coast, <br>
> Diplomatic mail, private post, <br>
> Rough drafts going unrevised, <br>
> and graffiti - have not its size.

Change words along the selection/combination axis: 
> That handiwork you hold, it seems - <br>
> Blockbusting books, cases coast-to-coast, <br>
> Diplomatic mail & private post, <br>
> Rough drafts remaining unrevised, <br>
> All gritty-city graffiti - <br>
> Together cannot have its size.

### Compose a poem by Cherry Picking
(I was a bit confused on the meaning of cherry picking, so I did my best understanding of it.)

Original inspiration (from the lecture slides):
> The work you are holding in your hands represents, itself alone, a quantity of text far greater than everything man has written since the invention of writing, including popular novels, business letters, diplomatic correspondence, private mail, rough drafts thrown into the wastebasket, and graffiti.

Cherry-picked poem:
> That work you hold in your hands <br>
> Itself alone, it is larger than all <br>
> Popular novels, business letters, diplomatic correspondence, private mail, rough drafts thrown out, graffiti <br>
> Ever composed by man

### Compose a lipogram.
A lipogram employs the constraint where some letter or letters is made unavailable for use. Losing a vowel constrains you considerably, especially if that vowel is e, a, or o, the most common in English usage.

Original Poem:
> Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, <br>
> With conquering limbs astride from land to land; <br>
> Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand <br>
> A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame <br>
> Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name <br>
> MOTHER OF EXILES. From her beacon-hand <br>
> Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command <br>
> The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. <br>
> "Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she <br>
> With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor, <br>
> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, <br>
> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. <br>
> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, <br>
> I lift my lamp beside the golden door!" <br>

Lipogram (removed a's):
> Not like the intrepid soul of Greek blood, <br>
> With conquering limbs stretched from shore to shore; <br>
> Here by our wide-sweeping, sunset columns, will support <br>
> The mighty mistress with her torch, whose fire-flood <br>
> Is the imprisoned lightning, it shouts her design: <br>
> MOTHER OF EXILES. From her bonfire-fist <br>
> Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes enlist <br>
> The sky-bridged port which twin cities do line. <br>
> "Keep, foregone shores, your storied pomp!" cries she <br>
> With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor, <br>
> Your huddled hordes longing to live free, <br>
> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. <br>
> Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, <br>
> I lift my light beside the golden door!" <br>
