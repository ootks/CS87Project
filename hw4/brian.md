# Oulipian Meeting - Computational Literature

### Compose a 3-word permutation poem.
It may or may not have all permutations, it may or may not have repetition of lines.

> Light your fire <br>
> Your light fire <br>
> Fire your light

### Compose a Biku.
A 3-line poem where two lines are identical or almost identical.

> Guerilla warfare <br>
> Against apes <br>
> Gorilla warfare

### Compose a Haiku Biku.
Tom La Farge suggested the form of Haiku Biku, forcing a 5-7-5 syllable structure on Biku (so that the first and third line are ~identical).

> Wondering about <br>
> The meaning of existence <br>
> Wandering about

### Rewrite this line in the form of a Haiku Biku
“You cannot step twice into the same river” said Heraklitus.

### Compose An Oulipian Médaille
An Oulipian Medal (Médaille) is a poem in the form of Haiku, where the third line should be similar to the first line (yet not identical), however the last N syllables must be “scrambled”, that is occur in a different order (N>=2).

### Compose a poetic line 
Use the “structuralist” algorithm.

> *General idea:* **I am hungry** <br>
> *Defamiliarize:* **Hunger _does something to_ me** <br>
> *Increase poetic function:* **Hunger _drains_ me** <br>
> **Hunger drains _my soul_** *(hyponym)* <br>
> **Hunger drains my _sorry soul_** *(alliteration)* <br>
> **Hunger drains my _sad sorry soul_** *(more alliteration)* <br>

### Compose a poem by Cherry Picking 
Ran the [HMM poem generation algorithm](https://github.com/brian112358/shakespeare) I wrote trained on Shakespearean sonnets until I got a result I liked:

> The music heart in hath in knowst praise, <br>
> In having find in tincture lovely leave. <br>
> Hers but the stronger verse were of decays, <br>
> Her minute little present gifts conceive. <br>
> The days in happy fairest race the truth, <br>
> In gentle dreadful precious substance had. <br>
> And heaven to hers bitter beauty ruth, <br>
> The spirit twain her fingers hied mad. <br>
> In love and worthy witness art and store, <br>
> Hers mud the proud without a world and pride. <br>
> Abundance as in homage but restore, <br>
> Delivers even goodly only tried. <br>
> In my infection gainst sweetly live, <br>
> Her shouldst hair a darkness of her thrive.

### Compose a lipogram.
A lipogram employs the constraint where some letter or letters is made unavailable for use. Losing a vowel constrains you considerably, especially if that vowel is e, a, or o, the most common in English usage.
