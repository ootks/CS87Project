2.Biku

We sing
Wheezing
Amongst the rumble

3. Haiku Biku

Gambol in the park
A couple tender touches
Gamble in the dark

5.
Some intense passions
Going on a camping trip
Pass on in some tents

8. Lipogram

No matter the desire,
I cannot inquire to
the cause for this affliction,
that excruciating friction.
It binds this tongue, crushes vowels
silences jokes, gags these howls
What has me under its power
upon this zeroeth hour
I do not know how
I do not know who
I do not know what
I do not know
