8. Lipogram

No matter the desire,
I cannot inquire to
the cause for this affliction,
that excruciating friction.
It binds this tongue, crushes vowels
silences jokes, gags these howls
What has me under its power
upon this zeroeth hour
I do not know how
I do not know who
I do not know what
I do not know
