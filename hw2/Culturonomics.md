# Imagist poems, in the style of “In a Station of the Metro”

### "In a Station of the Metro"

["In A Station of the Metro"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Station_of_the_Metro) is an Imagist poem by Ezra Pound published in 1913. The poem contains only fourteen words.

> The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
> Petals on a wet, black bough.

### "Patchwork"

> Individual, intimate, industrious impact;
> Snug summery quilt above.

This poem was inspired by the patchwork fields of rural America, and the multitude of communities and technologies that make it possible.

### "Pasadena Parrots"

> Parrots? Painful fact;
> Defiant flock of green noise.

This poem was inspired by the green parrots of Pasadena. There are [various theories](http://www.weirdca.com/location.php?location=112) as to how they arrived, including a parrot nursery fire, migration from Mexico, and black market smuggling gone-wrong. The parrots can be heard squawking in the morning and evening at Caltech campus. The [California Parrot Project](http://www.californiaparrotproject.org/) documents these birds.

# Ezra Pound Algorithm

We will apply the Pound Algorithm to F. Scott Fitzgerald's "We Leave To-night", published in 1920.

> We leave to-night...
> Silent, we filled the still, deserted street,
> A column of dim gray,
> And ghosts rose startled at the muffled beat
> Along the moonless way;
> The shadowy shipyards echoed to the feet
> That turned from night and day.
>  
> And so we linger on the windless decks,
> See on the spectre shore
> Shades of a thousand days, poor gray-ribbed wrecks...
> Oh, shall we then deplore
> Those futile years!
> See how the sea is white!
> The clouds have broken and the heavens burn
> To hollow highways, paved with gravelled light
> The churning of the waves about the stern
> Rises to one voluminous nocturne,
> ... We leave to-night.

A translation by the Pound Algorithm:

> To-night...
> Silent, the still, deserted street,
> Column of dim gray,
> Ghosts, muffled beat
> The moonless way;
> The shadowy shipyards
> Night, day.
>  
> The windless decks,
> The spectre shore
> Shades, thousand days, poor gray-rib wrecks...
> Oh, then deplore
> Those futile years!
> The sea is white!
> The clouds, the heavens
> To hollow highways, gravelled light
> Waves about the stern
> One voluminous nocturne,
> ... To-night.
