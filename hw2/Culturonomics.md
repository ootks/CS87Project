# Imagist poems, in the style of “In a Station of the Metro”

### "In a Station of the Metro"

["In A Station of the Metro"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Station_of_the_Metro) is an Imagist poem by Ezra Pound published in 1913. The poem contains only fourteen words.

> The apparition of these faces in the crowd; <br />
> Petals on a wet, black bough.

### "Patchwork"

> Individual, intimate, industrious impact; <br />
> Snug summery quilt above.

This poem was inspired by the patchwork fields of rural America, and the multitude of communities and technologies that make it possible.

### "Pasadena Parrots"

> Parrots? Painful fact; <br />
> Defiant flock of green noise.

This poem was inspired by the green parrots of Pasadena. There are [various theories](http://www.weirdca.com/location.php?location=112) as to how they arrived, including a parrot nursery fire, migration from Mexico, and black market smuggling gone-wrong. The parrots can be heard squawking in the morning and evening at Caltech campus. The [California Parrot Project](http://www.californiaparrotproject.org/) documents these birds.

# Ezra Pound Algorithm

We will apply the Pound Algorithm to F. Scott Fitzgerald's "We Leave To-night", published in 1920.

> We leave to-night... <br />
> Silent, we filled the still, deserted street, <br />
> A column of dim gray, <br />
> And ghosts rose startled at the muffled beat <br />
> Along the moonless way; <br />
> The shadowy shipyards echoed to the feet <br />
> That turned from night and day. <br />
> <br />
> And so we linger on the windless decks, <br />
> See on the spectre shore <br />
> Shades of a thousand days, poor gray-ribbed wrecks... <br />
> Oh, shall we then deplore <br />
> Those futile years! <br />
> See how the sea is white! <br />
> The clouds have broken and the heavens burn <br />
> To hollow highways, paved with gravelled light <br />
> The churning of the waves about the stern <br />
> Rises to one voluminous nocturne, <br />
> ... We leave to-night.

A translation by the Pound Algorithm:

> To-night... <br />
> Silent, the still, deserted street, <br />
> Column of dim gray, <br />
> Ghosts, muffled beat <br />
> The moonless way; <br />
> The shadowy shipyards <br />
> Night, day. <br />
> <br />
> The windless decks, <br />
> The spectre shore <br />
> Shades, thousand days, poor gray-rib wrecks... <br />
> Oh, then deplore <br />
> Those futile years! <br />
> The sea white! <br />
> The clouds, the heavens <br />
> To hollow highways, gravelled light <br />
> Waves about the stern <br />
> One voluminous nocturne, <br />
> ... To-night.
