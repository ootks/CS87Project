# Homework 7 - Computational Literature
Brian Lee

1. Favorite overall work.
Out of the works discussed in class, select the literary work you loved the most. Just specify its title and give a one sentence explanation that should convince me why you preferred this work over the others.

> "First My Motorola" (2006) <br>
> This work made me realize the pervasive nature of branding in our capitalist society; the brands Nemerov interacts with reveal her daily actions and her identity as a modern consumer.

2. Favorite work of each era.
Excluding your overall favorite work, select the work you loved the most in the Modernist, Postmodern and Internet eras. Just specify three titles and three explanation sentences.

> Modernist: "To Make a Dadaist Poem" (1920) <br>
> This work, a "recipe" for making a Dada poem, perfectly exemplifies the goal of the Dada movement: mocking and questioning the purpose of art and literature.

> Postmodern: "Hundred Thousand Billion" (1961) <br>
> This work really made me reflect on the limitless possibilities of writing; even with an extremely limited repository of lines (simply choosing a combination of 10 pre-determined lines), the possibilities are far too great for a single human to read through in their lifetime.

> Internet: "Statement of Facts" (2009) <br>
> In an Internet society in which information is so readily available, this work shows how analyzing seemingly mundane legal transcripts in a literary framework can generate deep and complex questions, thus emphasizing the value of context when examining information.

3. Favorite external work.
Locate a literary (in a very broad sense) work available online, that you think could seamlessly fit in the course. Provide a link and a sentence explaining why.

> [bot or not](http://botpoet.com/) <br>
> This website acts as a Turing test for poetry; by questioning the difference between computer-generated and human-generated poetry, it highlights the vanishing gap between human and computer ability.
