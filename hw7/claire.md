# Homework 7 - Computational Literature
Claire Goeckner-Wald

## 1. Favorite overall work.
Out of the works discussed in class, select the literary work you loved the most. Just specify its title and give a one sentence explanation that should convince me why you preferred this work over the others.

It's not a literary work, but my favorite work in this class was that of Moon Ribas, especially her motion-detecting earrings & cyborgism, because, you know, it's cool. My favorite literary work was the [Kick That Habit Man](https://nickm.com/memslam/permutation_poems.html) permutation poem. 

## 2. Favorite work of each era.
Excluding your overall favorite work, select the work you loved the most in the Modernist, Postmodern and Internet eras. Just specify three titles and three explanation sentences.

### Modernist
My favorite modernism movement was Ezra Pound's imagism, because it seems like a literary equivalent of Impressionism, one of my favorite styles of painting. For that reason, I choose:

> Young Woman at a Window (version 2) by William Carlos Williams <br>
> She sits with <br>
> tears on <br>
> her cheek <br>
> her cheek on <br>
> her hand <br>
> the child <br>
> in her lap <br>
> his nose <br>
> pressed <br>
> to the glass <br>

### Postmodern
My favorite work was Derrida's because I found [this](http://digressionsnimpressions.typepad.com/digressionsimpressions/2016/03/the-letter-against-derridas-honorary-degree.html) letter against him receiving an honorary degree while searching online about him, and it amused me. It's not really a 'work' per se, but I'm going to quote this, because I think it's especially ridiculous:

> “Literature has always appeared unacceptable to me, a scandal, the moral fault par excellence.” - Derrida

It makes me uncomfortable that someone who's made a living by writing would be so hypocritical. 

As for picking a favorite work with a title, I'd go with: 

> Talk Poem by David Antin <br>
> i had always had mixed feelings about being considered a poet <br>
> if robert lowell is a poet i don't want to be a poet <br>
> if robert frost is a poet i don't want to be a poet <br>
> if socrates is a poet i'll consider it <br>

It's a not-so-subtle rejection of Robert Lowell & Robert Frost. 

### Internet
I like this poem because I feel it's a creative way to express the interactions we have with our capitalist society on a day-to-day basis. At the same time, I don't like this poem because I feel it's length is unrealistically short - did people really touch so few branded items a day in 2006? If I feel that most everything I own is branded in some way. 

> First My Motorola by Alexandra Nemerov 
> First, my Motorola <br>
> Then my Frette <br>
> Then my Sonia Rykiel <br>
> Then my Bulgari <br>
> Then my Asprey <br>
> Then my Cartier <br>
> Then my Kohler <br>
> Then my Brightsmile <br>
> Then my Cetaphil <br>

## 3. Favorite external work.
Locate a literary (in a very broad sense) work available online, that you think could seamlessly fit in the course. Provide a link and a sentence explaining why.

I think that [this TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/john_mcwhorter_txtng_is_killing_language_jk) would fit in excellent with the discussion on Derrida. 

> Does texting mean the death of good writing skills? John McWhorter posits that there’s much more to texting — linguistically, culturally — than it seems, and it’s all good news.

Basically, it comes to the conclusion that texting is much closer to natural speech than formal writing is - and that's OK.
