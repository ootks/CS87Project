# WholesomeMemes Chatbot
## What are you going to do?

Scrape data from [/r/wholesomememes](reddit.com/r/wholesomememes) and generate wholesome replies to comments. We will use [The Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to scrape data.

## How (what techniques) are you going to do it?

Use Python to scrape and parse data from various comment threads on [/r/wholesomememes](reddit.com/r/wholesomememes). Then, train a learning algorithm using comment-reply pairs. Finally, use the trained model to generate wholesome responses to text inputs. 

## What is your poetic intention (or why do you think itâ€™s interesting / significant / poetic / cool / funny)?

The poetic intention is to put a new spin on text generation, using the "wholesome ____" trend, a relatively recent internet development.

## Chatbot In-action

## "I love you"

## "You're my best friend"
![screenshot2](https://github.com/ootks/CS87Project/blob/master/project/screenshot2.png "screenshot2") <br>

## "You're my best friend"
![screenshot3](https://github.com/ootks/CS87Project/blob/master/project/screenshot3.png "screenshot3") <br>
Note the use of "teenally".

## "You are beautiful"  
![screenshot4](https://github.com/ootks/CS87Project/blob/master/project/screenshot4.png "screenshot4") <br>
Note the mis-matched bracket. 

## "You are beautiful" many times

Each response is wildly different. One attempts to insert a Youtube URL. One attempts to use an emoticon "> )". (It's possible that a symbol that the user the algorithm sampled from was not shown.) A Google search of "diabably" reveals that it is a city in Mali. 

## "You're the best"
![screenshot6](https://github.com/ootks/CS87Project/blob/master/project/screenshot6.png "screenshot6") <br>
A short, sweet, and somewhat strange response. 

## "Bella Guo"
![screenshot8](https://github.com/ootks/CS87Project/blob/master/project/screenshot8.png "screenshot8") <br>
A strange but not implausible greeting. 

## "What's your name?"
![screenshot9](https://github.com/ootks/CS87Project/blob/master/project/screenshot9.png "screenshot9") <br>
The singularity approaches. 

## "What's your name?" many times
![screenshot11](https://github.com/ootks/CS87Project/blob/master/project/screenshot11.png "screenshot11") <br>
The singularity is not approaching.
