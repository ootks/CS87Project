# WholesomeMemes Chatbot
## What are you going to do?

Scrape data from [/r/wholesomememes](reddit.com/r/wholesomememes) and generate wholesome replies to comments. We will use [The Python Reddit API Wrapper](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to scrape data.

## How (what techniques) are you going to do it?

Use Python to scrape and parse data from various comment threads on [/r/wholesomememes](reddit.com/r/wholesomememes). Then, train a learning algorithm using comment-reply pairs. Finally, use the trained model to generate wholesome responses to text inputs. 

## What is your poetic intention (or why do you think itâ€™s interesting / significant / poetic / cool / funny)?

The poetic intention is to put a new spin on text generation, using the "wholesome ____" trend, a relatively recent internet development.
