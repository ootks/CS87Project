This make me feel so much betterHey just wanna let you all know that even if I don't know you or who you are I think you're probably a pretty great person and I'm sure there's a lot of people in your life that appreciate you even if you don't know it. I'm feeling pretty euphoric right now for some reason that I can't quite put my finger on so I ask you to help me in my quest tonight to spread good vibes throughout all of reddit. Anyway whoever you are reading this have a great night :)

Came to echo this, a disc broke apart while I was using my Dremel the other day and a piece was flung into my arm. Always take proper precautions, folks. Can I ask what happened to your arm? Were you wearing gear to protect yourself or did you need stitches or something?

fuck that. face shields.		I've seen pictures of people getting half an angle grinder disk through their cheeks.		and i won't even think of what happens if the neck is hit[deleted]
Im not usually one for safety equipment, but after having one of these shatter, fly across the room and pierce most of the way through the drywall, I got myself some safety glasses. >Im not usually one for safety equipment		This is an overall pretty stupid comment. Generally if you're cutting any sort of metal it's a good idea to wear safety glasses. Fuck, even if you're soldering it's important to have them on. Safety equipment shouldn't be a preference, it's a necessity.

Can I ask what happened to your arm? Were you wearing gear to protect yourself or did you need stitches or something?Wasn't wearing anything but a t-shirt to protect the arms, though I didn't have to get any stitches either. It's pretty small, around the width of a pencil. It happened while trying to cut a dash kit down to fit a car radio in, but I'll admit my ignorance in that I'd only used a dremel once before and probably let it overheat.
