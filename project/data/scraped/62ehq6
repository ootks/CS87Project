Great job friends!With all the anger and hate on Reddit, this place is fantastic. You guys are the best!
Great job friends!I really love this sub! One of my favorite.
Great job friends!I'm your buddy, pal!
Great job friends!Is Snoopy having a kid canon?
Great job friends!I'm not even gonna lie. This sub is the antidote humanity needs at the moment, with all the stuff going on. I'm glad I found it.
Great job friends!I love this sub. It's what the world needs. You guys are awesome. Have a great day everyone!!
Great job friends!That moment when you realize Snoopy is on a smaller version of his doghouse as a new born.
Great job friends!Every once in a while I got through r/all to find new communities and am met with toxic nonsense. 		Then I found this one and it made my day and gives me some motivation to work my way through r/all to see if new awesome communities are around. 
Great job friends!Its so nice to have one subreddit where everyone on reddit isn't a pissed off college kid. Can't even make a comment anymore without seven ppl saying something along the lines of "hurr durr, actually I know this and you don't even tho I'm wrong as well hurr durr". So annoying. But this place here is a safe happy haven away from all the negativity and it's great. Thanks everyone and thank you mods and thank you person who created this place.
Great job friends!#1 on /r/all! We did it!
Great job friends!I've gone through a lot lately and I've been really, really depressed. Most days I don't get out of bed. This sub makes me happy, though 
Great job friends!This sub is like a ray of sunshine right when we need it most 
Great job friends!i was tolerating this subreddit's fakeness but now it's smugness is getting out of hand. forced positivity invariable brings out other bad characteristics.

With all the anger and hate on Reddit, this place is fantastic. You guys are the best!Honest question,		Is the rise of this subreddit correlated to the polarization of all the political posts on the front page?		Because I feel it has.
With all the anger and hate on Reddit, this place is fantastic. You guys are the best!I purposefully came to this sub in need of cheering up I'm stay at home mom and I just decided to reenter the workforce and I'm feeling pretty obsolete. I was a photographer/retoucher so I guess the correct term is "washed up." 		The last three weeks have been an intense interview process for what can only be described as my dream job. Couldn't believe my luck and it was down to me and one other guy... unfortunately I got the news that I had been passed up for it this morning. 
I really love this sub! One of my favorite.It is my favourite for sure. I tend to forget the internet doesn't need to be toxic.
I'm your buddy, pal!I'm your pal, guy!
Is Snoopy having a kid canon?Asking the real questions here. I was hoping somebody would already have an answer when I opened these comments, since it's not canon in the comics, but then again, the animated series and comics are mostly independent.
Is Snoopy having a kid canon?One of the puppies in this meme is Snoopy (look at the pup lying on the red doghouse instead of a crib), the dog looking through the window here is one of Snoopy's parents.
Is Snoopy having a kid canon?Is it unwholesome to point out this implies Snoopy had sex at some point?
I'm not even gonna lie. This sub is the antidote humanity needs at the moment, with all the stuff going on. I'm glad I found it.Yeah definitely this. I spend so much time reading news this year, all of it very much unwholesome, I need some relief at the end of the day. This sub, /r/mademesmile, and anything involving gifs of dogs does a great job.
I love this sub. It's what the world needs. You guys are awesome. Have a great day everyone!!You're awesome! You have a great day too!

Thanks everyone and thank you mods and thank you person who created this place.Sometimes I worry that the mood'll turn sarcastic or ironic - or worse, obligatory, where you have no choice but to be over-the-top polite at all times, which will really take away those neat, introspective lows that bands everyone together to help an OP work through it.		:) I'm pretty happy that I'm in a sub where I can be invested and concerned in its future.

#1 on /r/all! We did it!Fantastic! Thanks for getting us here! 
Such a beautiful moment. I keep that gif on my phone in my 'need a lift' folder. Yay! For me the pic I keep coming back to is this one		http://imgur.com/QcJBeiE
/r/rarepuppersI love that sub so much.
So happy. I'm pregnant as fuck and thinking about how much I love my dog and loved her since I first met her makes me cry ahhhhh>pregnant as fuck		Love that :)
We'll done to us allWe'll alright! 
Honest question,		Is the rise of this subreddit correlated to the polarization of all the political posts on the front page?		Because I feel it has.That probably spurred a lot of people to jump on board with the wholesomeness, but I think the popularity is just a natural reaction to the negative nature of big web communities. Everyone was participating with their elbows out, forcing others to do the same. Now all of a sudden up pops a community that lets you put down your defense and gives you a big ol digital hug? Sign me up.
Honest question,		Is the rise of this subreddit correlated to the polarization of all the political posts on the front page?		Because I feel it has.Honest answer, it started as ironic "happy" memes in direct contrast with me_irl and stuff. Whether the change to honest positivity was for better or for worse is up to you
It is my favourite for sure. I tend to forget the internet doesn't need to be toxic.It's helped to remind me of that too. 		I hope you're having a lovely day ^_^
I'm your pal, guy!I'm your guy, buddy!
I'm your pal, guy!I'm your guy, gal!
Is it unwholesome to point out this implies Snoopy had sex at some point?Not if it's with a dog he loves and who cherishes him back!
Is it unwholesome to point out this implies Snoopy had sex at some point?Well, no, not at face-value. If you're pointing it out to take away from the fact that Snoopy looks pretty excited to be a dad, then yes, that probably would be unwholesome. :)
You're awesome! You have a great day too!Have a great night, buddies from europe! :)
Yay! For me the pic I keep coming back to is this one		http://imgur.com/QcJBeiEThat's the best thing ever

I'm your guy, buddy!I'm your buddy, fwend!
That's the best thing ever Sharing this happily with everyone I know who won't be dicks about me trying to be happy.
[When nobody notices your nice hat but you're gonna keep rockin it because you know it's good](http://i.imgur.com/pN4tz9P.jpg)I notice you and your nice hat! It's a great hat! :)

I started spending more time here when I noticed I was subbed all the way down to /r/2meirl42meirl4meirl it's not a great place. It is helpful in its own way though.I'm subscribed to all the major me_irl subs and this one to. Yet I wouldn't know which is better.		One would think /r/wholesomememes, but that's not always the case. Like, earlier today there was a post about a woman that met her husband in a funny way. That post made me very depressed because it reminded me of what I don't have and will probably never have. 		Yet another post in /r/2meirl4meirl was about not killing yourself because of your family. Clearly this is very negative. Yet it made me feel like I'm not alone. And there are many people that are a lot worse than me. 		I don't even remember what was my point in the first place. Just felt like sharing, sorry.		Have a nice day.
I'm your buddy, fwend!I'm your fwend, dawg!
I notice you and your nice hat! It's a great hat! :) Did r/wholesomememes created a meta in itself?
I notice you and your nice hat! It's a great hat! :) Thanks fren !

You're right, how a post on those subreddits affects one is very subjective and sometimes it's good to know you're not the only one feeling low. Thanks for sharing!
