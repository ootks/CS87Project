We made this!!What's the strange half finished flag under Germany and to the left of the van Gogh? 
We made this!!Don't forget that /r/wholesomememes is represented in the form of Love on this wonderful piece of art work!! It was truly a great pleasure to work on.
We made this!!I FEEL SO PROUD TO HAVE BROUGHT PEACE, FREEDOM, JUSTICE, AND SECURITY TO OUR NEW EMPIRE

We made this!!Hello! This is just a quick reminder for new friendos to [read our subreddit rules.](/r/wholesomememes/about/sidebar)		>**Rule 4:** Please do not troll, harass, or be generally rude to your fellow users.		We're trusting you to be wholesome while in /r/wholesomememes, so please don't let us down. We believe in you!		^(Please stop by the rest of the) [^Wholesome ^Network ^Of ^Subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/u/awkwardtheturtle/m/wholesome)  ^also.		
We made this!!I know we're supposed to try to be as wholesome as possible on this sub, but I can't help but be upset that you used the picture with OP's big fat cursor over the Toronto Maple Leafs logo. I helped work on that and I want people to be able to see all the effort we put into it :(
We made this!!I hope the real version is the one with the Chicago Bears logo with the Finnish flag because it made me happy but I understand if people changed it
We made this!!Every time I see this I get angry. Some Brits wrote a script and killed the logo I helped create on Friday night and Saturday morning and spent the whole weekend protecting. Their script along with a ton of alt accounts wiped us off the map and now the piece I worked on isn't represented at all on the final picture everyone keeps posting. 
We made this!!And in the end, the osu! logo is still visible! I'm so glad we managed to survive all the griefers. If only it had ended a couple hours earlier, we would've had a pristine logo, but at least everyone can still tell what it is.
We made this!!No joke this has to be my favorite work of art of all time. I spend so much time on the internet that it's nice to see a piece of art that truly represents it. On top of that, everyone worked together on it, and it's incredible to see how it evolved over time. People might think that this sounds stupid, but I see no reason to take this any less seriously than other works of art (other than things like "Unregistered Hupercum :P).
We made this!!I decided to [uplift his smile](http://imgur.com/AomLQ9S) :)
We made this!!My favourite thing is the big trans flag stretching across the canvas. It was trans day of visibility when Place launched, so we built a big flag. It was nice to see Reddit rally round us against the Void. You guys are great.
We made this!!*bleep, bloop* Congrats to my fellow humans on our accomplishment!
We made this!!Oh man, you can see the trans flag stretching all the way across the whole thing. That's awesome. <3
We made this!!One of the things I like best is that some folks tried to add a pepe at the middle left early on, and everyone else just went 'nope!' and wiped it out. 
We made this!!It's cool, but I also think it's weird, because most of it is advertising.

so I didn't really follow this over the weekend, is there an explanation somewhere of how this was created?It was reddit's April fools community engagement thing this year. Basically, there was a 1,000 x 1,000 pixel canvas where every user could colour a single pixel every 5 minutes. People started joining together to create pixel art, fill the canvas with colour, create patterns, write the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise, and make banners and logos to support their subreddits. It was great, and there was a real sense of community. People banded together to protect artwork from vandalism, communities made alliances to not colour over each others pixels, and flags expanded to meet and join together with hearts. It was really quite wonderful.

It's cool, but I also think it's weird, because most of it is advertising.Yes and no. It's not some corporate sponsorship thing, it's groups of people showing off the places and games and other things that they love. So while it is advertising, it's not really meant to sell products

I find it amusing that as Germany ran over France, the French just moved north of Germany and then the EU flag took over that same space to 'override' the GermansThat was actually all planned by r/europe :). I was part of the rainbowroad crew that built over it becauase they wouldn't answer pm's.
Um What's up with the huge ass blue at bottom right. Was that just random plan of making whole thing blue? Didn't see the goal of that one and kinda waste of effort as it was overwritten like a background colourThat was the blue team, they were trying to take the whole thing. It all started as a color war but was quickly taken over by designs and bots. The bots bummed me out, I wish it were all organic. Still a cool project though.

Aw it's over?!  Yeah, April 1st social experiment courtesy of reddit. Started Friday afternoon with no warning and no one knew how long it would last. Turned out to be 72 hours.		Was pretty fun. I helped the rainbow road bounce around and grow on Friday, then helped my Heroes of the Storm friends Sat/Sun with our  logo. Proud of it but if the place continued indefinitely we would've 	 had to give up our space eventually, so kinda glad it ended. We're part of the final image and looking sharp up in the top left corner!
> kekistan		not very wholesome at all :(You know, I think the fun of finding out that their slang borrowed from Warcraft/Starcraft (kek) matched an ancient Egyptian frog deity of chaos when they consider themselves chaotic and represent themselves through a sad cartoon frog, and embracing these coincidences as a community, was actually pretty wholesome. I know they then use this as a rallying point for unwholesome activity, but the origin of it all isn't much different from many moments on r/place itself, a group of bored geeks with a passion finding things that just happen to work together and finding unity in that.		Just to be clear, this isn't supporting them or what they do. Just appreciating the non-harmful coincidences of a frog from a comic, video game slang and ancient deities.
> kekistan		not very wholesome at all :(I dunno, I always thought of kekistan as a silly thing and not really anything hateful or derogatory.
> kekistan		not very wholesome at all :(4chan is one of the least wholesome places on the internet. The only time I've seen them being wholesome is when cute animals are posted.

Pepe used to be good but he's been stolen by certain unsavoury and *most certainly unwholesome* groups. I don't think you should let them take over the meaning of Pepe for you.

I'm also glad there wasn't much political stuff.

General socialism, different types of anarchism, some libertarian symbols, etc. But no party politics (that I could see) around any country's flag.		The more general the concept the less people are going to argue.
Did have sickle and hammer tho :(I interpret that symbol as the unity of the working people, urban (hammer) and rural (sickle) alike, against the exploitation of their labor. Liberation is wholesome! :)

There was no treaty between them and rainbowroad until the end.

The rainbow that filled the flag is suspected of being a false flag attack by void in combination with a hivemind of unaffiliated users simply expanding artwork. Whatever it was, though, the attack was not sanctioned by /r/ainbowroad leadership.

Right?! Communism never hurt anyone! are you trying to say capitalism has killed *less* people? 
You know, I think the fun of finding out that their slang borrowed from Warcraft/Starcraft (kek) matched an ancient Egyptian frog deity of chaos when they consider themselves chaotic and represent themselves through a sad cartoon frog, and embracing these coincidences as a community, was actually pretty wholesome. I know they then use this as a rallying point for unwholesome activity, but the origin of it all isn't much different from many moments on r/place itself, a group of bored geeks with a passion finding things that just happen to work together and finding unity in that.		Just to be clear, this isn't supporting them or what they do. Just appreciating the non-harmful coincidences of a frog from a comic, video game slang and ancient deities.Good explanation! Pepe is not a hate symbol!!
4chan is one of the least wholesome places on the internet. The only time I've seen them being wholesome is when cute animals are posted.Nah, 4chan has a much worse rep than they should, mostly because people chose to believe rumors and myths over actually visiting it. Most of 4chan are normal boards that work similarly to reddit, the popular ones are a mixed bag because it was\is a pretty big community. 		They tracked\reported ISIS bases, pedophiles, rapists, lots of animal abuse cases and did random acts of kindness a few times. There are some bad eggs that usually just results in internet harassment, and I guess the majority of what they do is morally neutral and "for the lulz" (altough often involving crude humour). Oh, and like 80% of classic internet memes comes from 4chan.
If you are not with me, then you are my enemy!It is a common belief that only a Sith would deal in absolutes but that in itself would be an absolute, so while I hope you may become a little less black and white after hearing my side of things, I can only ask you to do and say what you're most comfortable with.  
No politics, barely any boobs or dicks, no real gore, no hate, yeah I'm genuinely surprised. Well done, Reddit. Other than the initial dick and obligatory dickbutt, the only boobs I saw were the Mona Lisa's. 
No politics, barely any boobs or dicks, no real gore, no hate, yeah I'm genuinely surprised. Well done, Reddit. Not to mention that /r/Palestine and /r/Israel actually didn't vandalize eachother (or individuals did and we're denounced for it by the majority of the members of each respective subreddit.)		Oh, and that great /r/Sweden and /r/Maryland collab. Good job, guys.		Edit: Parentheses
No politics, barely any boobs or dicks, no real gore, no hate, yeah I'm genuinely surprised. Well done, Reddit. Well there were some politics and dicks they just weren't very large.
No politics, barely any boobs or dicks, no real gore, no hate, yeah I'm genuinely surprised. Well done, Reddit. This is why we CAN have nice things
No politics, barely any boobs or dicks, no real gore, no hate, yeah I'm genuinely surprised. Well done, Reddit. > No politics		Well except for the German invasion of France, and the EU intervention. Also subreddits were making treaties with each other for space and going to "war"
No politics, barely any boobs or dicks, no real gore, no hate, yeah I'm genuinely surprised. Well done, Reddit. Actually, the far left has a hammer and scythe, along with some other leftist symbols. I think r/FC and r/FA got together and made that.
4chan were building their weird green Third Reich flag but it was destroyed.It was the flag of their meme country Kekistan, which is a parody of the Third Reich's flag, so it's only kinda related to the Nazis in the fact that it's shaped like their flag and it was fucking annihilated by the rest of the world.

Lol, like Reddit would allow Swastikas and Hitler stuff on their own sponsored Subreddit.Swastikas were thought of as space that no one would mind you conquering.
Lol, like Reddit would allow Swastikas and Hitler stuff on their own sponsored Subreddit.I love how you guys pull stuff out of your asses.
Swastikas were regularly removed by admins.People keep saying that, but I don't know why. Did the admins made a no Swastikas rule?
I thought the snake was made by r/sneks	Really?  I spent three days contributing to it thinking it was a libertarian thing...  I even started the black rectangle around it and the black border around the snek.  Haha.  That's ok.  Was fun.
I thought the snake was made by r/sneks	Green snake was, yellow snake was made by ancaps.
Probably because the second anything political appeared, the other side immediately jumped on it. They canceled each other out. Maybe, I'm just speculating.I saw an attempt to write r/the_donald above the US flag that got instantly covered in rainbow.
Hey man, regardless of any political side, I thought [comrade party parrot](http://imgur.com/a/YUtm1) was adorableThere was even some adorable artwork of the bird from a Pokmon fan game that happened to have a home in the same section. 		http://i.imgur.com/7TrhvxX.png		Apparently a [sweet gift from one of the game's creators](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFarLeftSide/comments/62uw48/our_little_bird_comrade_would_like_to_thank_you/) after their sprite was embraced by the community.
Another fine addition to my collection.  I like how everyone used to hate the prequels like Anakin hates sand, but now everyone kind of likes them. Ironic.
It's a sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
WE'RE incredibleDONKEY!
I got alot of accounts so I was busy all the time.Shhhhh.  You're not supposed to admit that.
It is a common belief that only a Sith would deal in absolutes but that in itself would be an absolute, so while I hope you may become a little less black and white after hearing my side of things, I can only ask you to do and say what you're most comfortable with.  i can't believe this...you turned "only a sith deals in absolutes" into a wholesome meme		if i had money i'd seriously give you all the gold
Other than the initial dick and obligatory dickbutt, the only boobs I saw were the Mona Lisa's. Brazil had a butt above their flag, too.
Other than the initial dick and obligatory dickbutt, the only boobs I saw were the Mona Lisa's. are her tits still out? i'ma go check.		edit: help i can't find mona lisa		e2: hey, she's fixed
Instead, corporate sponsorshipsSponsorship? I don't think anyone got paid.
It was the flag of their meme country Kekistan, which is a parody of the Third Reich's flag, so it's only kinda related to the Nazis in the fact that it's shaped like their flag and it was fucking annihilated by the rest of the world.Yeah, the joke is that they're called nazis contantly despite not being nazis, so it's a joke at their own expense.
[removed]Pretty not wholesome tbh 
People keep saying that, but I don't know why. Did the admins made a no Swastikas rule?You don't understand why the admins didn't want Nazi symbols on it? It really isn't a hard concept to grasp.

DONKEY!Your pottery looks pretty good.		*You* look pretty good.
When did I mention anything about capitalism? Okay, I'll take that back- why is "communism's track record" or whatever worse than other ideologies that have been used in the past few centuries? 
Brazil had a butt above their flag, too.Well they've earned that. Brazil is famous for nice butts and losing 7-1 at home. That wasn't very wholesome of me. Uhh...Brazil tried their hardest and what really matters is the friends you make along the way?
are her tits still out? i'ma go check.		edit: help i can't find mona lisa		e2: hey, she's fixedMona lisa is just left of the american flag towards the middle. during its creation a very dedicated few were trying to get her tits out, but were overcome in the final effort. You can see it a bit in the timelapse

Well they've earned that. Brazil is famous for nice butts and losing 7-1 at home. That wasn't very wholesome of me. Uhh...Brazil tried their hardest and what really matters is the friends you make along the way?It was a constant fight to keep the 7-1 out of the brazil flag, actually. There was always someone trying to put it at the top left corner of the flag, but we managed to go without it by the end.

No but since all the bots did mostly marketable logos, reddit can now use this to charge advertisers saying see how much users like corporate stuff.. or something like that... "your brand has recognition on reddit, dont wanna lose it, or see your brand needs more recognition on reddit".... bots were great for them, but terrible for the spirit of what place could have been.. but reddit is a business... if this was strictly the "social experiment" it was maybe supposed to be, scripts wouldnt have been allowed and whatever genuine pixel placers woud have created would have been it... I don't think your accusations of corporate shilling are very wholesome. People worked hard to put logos in that represent their community, because it was the easiest way for everyone to agree on something that easily represented them. I don't think, for example, the OSU! guys were doing it because they're corporate shills, I think OSU! worked hard to try to make a giant logo because they love their game and wanted it represented in an easily identifiable way. Most of the logos were from games, anyways. There were a couple, like IKEA, but that was clearly a funny Sweden meme. I think having IKEA on the Swedish flag made it funnier than not having IKEA on the Swedish flag, even if you consider that "corporate".

I believe "nazi navy" is a bit of a misnomer. Yeah, they were the navy for nazi Germany, but just as your average German soldier wasn't a nazi neither was a sailor.[deleted]

Link to said timelapse?[here is a ten min timelapse](https://archive.org/details/reddit-place-timelapse-daily-long)		other shorter gifs are pretty much everywhere right now.
I've seen users post on r/place about making it a weekly thing but who knows?I feel like some things are so special they are not meant to be regular things. This was one of those things that are now part of human history.
[removed]r/The_Donald is over there, buddy. 		I came here to be wholesome, not to talk about politics.
Have you seen what happens on the internet when things "run wild"? A bunch of edgy memeing kids make chattbots praise Hitler and renounce Jews in a couple of days.		These people know what happens when you let stuff go unadminisrated. It would have been filled with swastikas, Pepes, Bernie sander and trump symbols and other stuff. I much more prefer this results over that.> Have you seen what happens on the internet when things "run wild"?		Yes /r/Place 		The thing is that /r/place had all th elements to police itself. See a Nazi symbol? Vandalize it. See a 4chan pseudo-fascist project? Turn it into a gay flag.		The racist things couldnt survive because the entire sub would oppose it.
