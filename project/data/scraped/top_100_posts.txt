Fun is the name of the game!I like this guy. I was mentored in basketball by a guy named Kendall Webb, and he was the top scoring player on the Wayland Baptist University basketball team. When he noticed that many of the players were beating themselves up over practice, he pulled us aside and told us that if weren't weren't having fun, there was no reason for us to be here. He told us that in the end, it's really just entertainment for both us and the viewers in the stands, and we needed to remember to have fun. That really stuck with me, and that was when I learned to enjoy sports for the fun of it.

Here's to hoping for a big group hug at midfield before the game along with some well-wishingWell... a fight didn't break out. That's pretty damn good for OSU vs Michigan!
Is that real?It was from ESPN Gameday this morning for the heated Ohio State-Michigan rivalry that's been played since 1897! 
Is that real?It is real because it's a wonderful thought to have, and there are many many people who think like that every single day. Maybe one of them is near you now. Give them a hug or tell them what a wonderful person they are.
And also that everyone on the public enjoys the game :)I hope they don't fight a lot in each other's respective team subreddit.
Go sports![bengles over there making the worst calls!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdwchohlMjI&t=66s)

Smiles all roundSounds like Dad needs a fence and a book about how to raise Alpacas for his birthday.     		Edit: that's what I get for trusting autocorrect.

Smiles all roundThat's my dad! This is hilarious because he's always travelling and sending us pictures and messages like this, and we always talk about how meme-worthy he is. Glad the rest of the world got to experience some Dimitri :)
Smiles all roundI saw this on Twitter yesterday and it made me so happy. It is wonderful to see someone who is experiencing pure joy.
Smiles all roundI can't help but be reminded of [Kristen Bell's sloth meltdown on Ellen](https://youtube.com/watch?v=t5jw3T3Jy70). They're all too adorable.
Smiles all roundI mean this in the most sincere way: The first time I touched an alpaca changed my life. Their wool feels like a teddy bear made of dreams. If you haven't felt one, go to your local petting zoo and do it now. If your local petting zoo doesn't have an alpaca, find a new place to live. Just be sure to pet the other animals first. After touching an alpaca, petting a sheep will feel like rubbing sandpaper covered in brillo pads. It might actually cut your hand open.		If God has deemed you worthy and you have felt an alpaca, take a friend who hasn't to the petting zoo. I cannot describe to you the joy you get when you watch them have their first alpaca experience. It's like being at your best friend's wedding, or welcoming a newborn baby into the world. A truly magical, once in a lifetime experience.		If you love someone this Christmas, get them alpaca socks. If you really love someone (like really, really love them), get them an alpaca sweater. They will forever remember you as the person who changed their lives for the better. 
Smiles all roundI can understand his joy. Alpacas are like the friendlier version of llamas (though they are still very territorial ~~and can give nasty bites if they choose~~ no they can't, their jaws don't allow it. TIL). Plus they are indeed mega soft and fluffy. Knitting with alpaca wool yarn is like knitting with clouds made of love. <3
Smiles all roundA neighbor of mine has two he just raises as pets, I can definitely confirm they're the softest thing I've ever felt. Plus, they're super friendly, they see you walking outside their pen, they instantly run over for pets. 		Edit: [Picture of one of the lovely ladies](https://i.imgur.com/asbpz0C.jpg)

I have just taken up knitting again after a long hiatus and if I keep it up, I'm going to finally treat myself to some alpaca yarn.It's really nice and I've found it can be cheaper than wool! Unfortunately I've also found that I'm allergic to alpaca :( Other fibres are okay for me though so that's fine, you win some you lose some.
i thought they couldn't really bite because they only have bottom teeth?Been bitten by an alpaca can confirm that it doesn't hurt at all. They can kick though.
You sound like a lucky person.Make your own luck, friendo.

Ahhhh, that would make sense, was he on his way to Machu Picchu? I'm planning a hiking trip up there next year! 		I've been to Ingapirca in Ecuador and it was truly beautiful, but nothing rivals the hidden beauty of Machu Picchu.

If we didn't only have 2 I'd take that trade. To be honest our alpaca are so much more difficult to shear than our sheep. They spit and kick. How do you shear your sheep?I use a trimming stand because my wife and daughter aren't of much help aside from standing around and laughing at me catch them. Our sheep are BIG hardy Arabian sheep. Not the kind you see at the county fair getting sheared in seconds. I have seven of them and lucky if I can get them all done in a month. I've called 4H, I've offered up to 50 bucks a head for someone to come out and do it, but I don't have enough apparently for anyone to be bothered with it. Aside from that they require VERY little maintenance. Yea, forget an alpaca then. I've been looking at miniature cattle actually. I just need pasture management.

And then you get to save another dog and make another person or family happy.my roommate fostered a dog recently and she ended being such a great pupper that she decided to fully adopt her.
That's a good dog, Bront. vvv good pupper n vvv good gramper

This might be one of my favorite subs because I'm not a very positive person sometimes and it helps me think and feel a lot more positively!So I used to have this problem. What I am going to say may sound dumb, but it really helped me out. 		One time I read a book called The Happiness Advantage. One of the tips to bring happier was to write down three good things every day. I thought it was bs, tried it, was bs.		Here is the thing though. Happiness is an internal system of perception. Which means it's a habit you can learn. 		So I stuck it out again. For months. Every day. A lot of the things were silly. Some were legit big moments for me. I still have notebooks filled with these notes to myself. 		It took probably three months of this before I noticed a difference. I still do it, and I know it helps me be more content with my life. 		Anyway give it a try. You may not be surprised.

We feign interest, we feign understanding when we don't feel it, and we feign civility when what we really want to do is rip people's heads off for driving poorly. But for society to function we all feign civility, especially when we don't feel it. Sure, it's probably not as good as genuine kindness, but I'll take it if the alternative is anger, vitriol, and selfishness like 90% of the rest of reddit...

There are a lot of reasons people sub here, and ironic sincerity is certainly one of them. But I think you'll find that the "niceness" for most of us here is just a cover for "kindness."		I get how the whole hyper-positivity thing can be burdensome, or very easily be seen - as you say- "cultish." But really, people come here for all kinds of reasons, but they stay for one reason: it's satisfying.		It's satisfying to tell people they're doing well. It's satisfying to push a person toward their own goals. It's satisfying to look at a picture of a pupper, and agree with everyone that it's a good pupper.		And most importantly, sadness and negativity isn't banned here, we merely ask that it not be the topic of discussion. If you spend enough time in the comments, I think you'll find that many people will jump at the chance to help someone who is having a hard time. This sub isn't devoid of people with issues. On the contrary, it's full of humans who have done their best, and are optimistic enough to offer their happiness and insight to the rest of us.

When I post something positive about someone here, I don't actually know the person or their positive traits, but I'm sure they have good qualities and no harm can come from saying something positive even if I don't actually know anything about the person.
I like to view this sub as being full of people who are actually sad or depressed but are just faking it til they make it, and encouraging each other along the way, and that makes me feel not so sad.Every time you think a positive thought, write a positive message, smile, laugh, walk with a happy gait, or with a skip in your step you influence the millions of neural pathways in your brain and build connections that make these things easier to access and so come easier and more naturally. 		In other words, even if you're faking it you will one day make it. A positive space can also be very therapeutic in a world where depression is almost a meme. Even if people are just being ironic or funny, I think places like this can be an important thing for a lot of people.

You're proving my pointWhat's wrong with a mixture of genuinely friendly posts and a love circlejerk? It's 10 seconds of good vibes between bad news, political turmoil and crippling depression dominating the front page :)
You're proving my pointAlthough I disagree with your point, it's a pleasure watching you prove it here on this internet forum. 
You're proving my pointIsn't circlejerking the whole point of this sub?
It will take the truthfulness out of it, which is kind of unsettling. To be polite and nice ironically? It weirds me out. Granted, you can't ever know for certain on a messageboard like this, but it's going to feel like something out of uncanny valleyWe are what we pretend to be. Even if someone ironically acts happy and positive, what influence does that have? I'd argue that it'd still brighten other people's days--including the pretender's. It's like when you smile when you're sad. It actually makes you happier, even if it's not a genuine smile.
What makes you disagree with me?Look at pretty much every other sub on reddit: they're all circlejerks of some kind. That's how reddit works. But whereas other subs are pure cynicism, anger, hatred, and general negativity, this place is like a breath of fresh air, as long as you leave your cynicism at the door. Let yourself be a little naive, and don't worry about whether everyone is 100% sincere. Not everyone on /r/meirl is suicidal, and god knows everyone on blackpeopletwitter is actually a white teenager; but as long as everyone shares in the common delusion, who cares? What's the harm in letting everyone believe for just a minute that the world we wanted to see everywhere as a kid is just as real as we always hoped? What's so bad about being good for no reason?
I honestly thought this sub was tongue in cheek It isn't ?
reportedWell if you find this fun I guess that's okay :)
Am Canadian. This place is even nicer than Canada it seems!		Or at least pretty close! deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6750

Marshmellows are never an inconvenience. Unless you make them yourself, which I don't. I'll just grab some for you from the bag. And I'll throw in some mini ones as well, from the other bag. There you go!Huh never thought about making my own marshmallows. I think I'll give it a try
Here, have some gold.thanks for the gold kind stranger!

It's like when you smile when you're sad. It actually makes you happier, even if it's not a genuine smile.Eh idk about that, fake niceties and politeness can lead some people to have issues. I personally find it distasteful. Thankfully I don't seem to see any of that around this sub, but I see why the OP might be concerned. 
i'm not sure there has been truthfulness from the start and it always felt mocking and pretentiousI've posted here genuinely hoping to spread a bit of positivity. Made me feel better too. Once you start to realise how much negativity there can be online, it's good to have a break.

It isn't ?Look at /r/MURICA. That place isn't entirely made up of people who are fanatically devoted to the USA and totally drunk, but there's a sincere amount of patriotism there. Just because people are being purposely sappy here, why does that mean that in reality they're just being spiteful? Can't it mean people are just playing at being a little nicer? And what's so bad about that?
thanks for the gold kind stranger!I second this. 
Honestly this sub tends to be a circle jerk of kindness but it is just so relieving having a bastion of niceness on the internet. So I keep having to come back.It is a circlejerk of kindness. But everywhere else on Reddit is so depressing and cynical that we kind of need it for balance.

I honestly can't tell if I'm being trolled or notYou aren't. This place is the last bastion of kindness on Reddit. It's actually really refreshing to let your guard down and just be nice :)
I like the way you think. Put a smile on your face, and others will ask where you got it :)
It is a circlejerk of kindness. But everywhere else on Reddit is so depressing and cynical that we kind of need it for balance.This, exactly.

Natalie did a great job!He is really nice he visited my college to congratulate people who passed their cooking course and tried some of the food.
Natalie did a great job!I love Gordon Ramsay on a personal level. I'm going to copy [my post from a few years back](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1nbryx/gordon_ramsay_builds_up_a_blind_chefs_confidence/ccha29v/) to explain why:		*I love Chef Ramsay. My, at the time, 15yo brother looked up to him. Regarded him so highly. He spent $100 of his own pocket money to attend a food festival Ramsay had flown down to here in Australia. He paid another $20 to get his signature, then informed Chef Ramsay that coming to see him was his birthday present that he saved up all year for himself and he wanted to be like him. Chef put down his pen, said "We can't leave a chef go without presents!". He then gave my brother a copy of his cookbooks, all signed, a set of knives, a chefs hat and apron and took many photos with him. My littlest brother was so proud of that day and since then, I have thought nothing but good things of Ramsay. He really is an awesome guy that has been demonized as a bad one because of the character he portrays on TV.*		My brother is now leading a team of chefs at a hotel in Hong Kong and doing mighty well for himself. I've no doubt Chef Ramsay is partly responsible for this		
Natalie did a great job!I would love to see Gordon Ramsey do a spin-off show called Wholesome Kitchen, where everyone just tries their best and has fun cooking in a supportive environment. Gordon could deliver scathing quips like "if this filet were any more raw, well then by golly that'd be ok too because the only true mistakes in the kitchen are the ones we don't learn from." Over the course of a some-holds-barred, low pressure culinary faceoff lasting 40 minutes (or more if you need it, these things happen to the best of us), the contestants will discover that sometimes the sweetest dish of all is friendship. 
Natalie did a great job!Gordon is definitely on the top of my list over people I would like to have a beer or dinner with.	
Natalie did a great job!Yes, it indeed looks delicious!
Natalie did a great job!A cat who hates Mondays would probably agree.
Natalie did a great job!That's not lasagne that's my daughter!
Natalie did a great job!Lasagna is really tasty. I'd like to learn to make some one day. 
Natalie did a great job!I am not sure how scripted Kitchen Nightmares was, but I always recall fondly the one where Gordon empowers this waiter who was in his 70's, maybe older, to bring back his specialty-flambes! Not quite as popular as they once were, but Gordon felt it was something that was unique and could be a strength. 		I think that show was a good example of how you can work with what you have, try to elevate a few things, cut out the people who are unwilling to learn or change for the better, and you end up with a restaurant that is unique, has some soul and can be profitable. 
Natalie did a great job!Good job Natalie!
Natalie did a great job!This sub is showing up regularly on the front page		I must say it's great to see such a positive environment become liked by so many!
Natalie did a great job!I know this is r/wholesomememes, but it's still so alien to me to see this sort of Twitter screenshot without it being some sort of abstract meme or dirty joke
Natalie did a great job!Gordon Ramsay being a sweetheart is one of my favourite things in the world
Natalie did a great job!God damn now I want lasagna. Luckily I'm Italian and always have the stuff to make it.

I'm glad to see that Gordon Ramsay is a great guy outside of his TV persona :)He posts videos on his Youtube Channel where he cooks with his kids, very wholesome :D
I'm glad to see that Gordon Ramsay is a great guy outside of his TV persona :)He's only a jerk to chefs who are professionals and think they're perfect. On the shows where he works with amateur chefs who actually want to learn, he's really nice.
I'm glad to see that Gordon Ramsay is a great guy outside of his TV persona :)I remember this episode from the UK version, where he visits some soul food restaurant in London and from the first bite he is just under a spell: you can clearly see this is some of the best he's ever had and just really feel bad for the owner not to have success because her food is 10/10 and she cooks it with a passion and high quality. Excellent episode, really think it reflects the true Gordon.
I'm glad to see that Gordon Ramsay is a great guy outside of his TV persona :)Part of it is how his American shows are edited and scripted. But even then, [he can be very supportive.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIGXboHpge0)
I'm glad to see that Gordon Ramsay is a great guy outside of his TV persona :)Probably one of the nicest celebrities I've met. Was in vegas and he happened to be there for the UFC fights, he came to his burger restaurant we were eating at and after talking to the chefs he let everyone shake his hand and take pictures with him and was cracking jokes. Great dude.
I'm glad to see that Gordon Ramsay is a great guy outside of his TV persona :)Watch his UK shows instead, completely different guy and way less dramatic and scripted.
I'm glad to see that Gordon Ramsay is a great guy outside of his TV persona :)On Masterchef Junior it's clear that even when a kid has made a terrible dish, he makes sure his criticism is gentle and constructive because the *last* thing he wants is for any of these kids who have incredible potential to get discouraged and stop cooking. 
I'm glad to see that Gordon Ramsay is a great guy outside of his TV persona :)I've never worked with Gordon personally, however I've heard from some reliable sources that he isn't really what he's edited out to be. 		Don't get it wrong, he is a Chef. And ALL proper chefs are direct and to the point when they are working. There is now "It would be great if you handed me that knife so I can cut this piece of chicken or fish". or "Golly, i do believe you might have made this a bit too salty".. Typically things said in as little words as possible, because of the high speed of operation of a busy restaurant. 
I'm glad to see that Gordon Ramsay is a great guy outside of his TV persona :)He's more of a mean guy for TV, brings in views.

I am not sure how scripted Kitchen Nightmares was, but I always recall fondly the one where Gordon empowers this waiter who was in his 70's, maybe older, to bring back his specialty-flambes! Not quite as popular as they once were, but Gordon felt it was something that was unique and could be a strength. 		I think that show was a good example of how you can work with what you have, try to elevate a few things, cut out the people who are unwilling to learn or change for the better, and you end up with a restaurant that is unique, has some soul and can be profitable. Yeah Gordon is always willing to try to get you to improve it seems like, and he isn't as harsh with kids as he is with adults. With kids he encourages them not to give up and that they can be a chef some day. I saw one video where he cheers up a crying girl saying her food was fine and everything was alright.

He posts videos on his Youtube Channel where he cooks with his kids, very wholesome :DThose are from his 2013/2014 series, Gordon Ramsay's Home Cooking. In that one, every episode has a theme and he teaches you how to cook a dish of that theme for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 		Another great one he has is his Ultimate Cookery Course. He teaches a lot more basic skills over all here. How to properly dice things, what kind of cookware you need that is bare minimum, he even goes into how to select ingredients and all the different types there are and their uses. E.g. Peppercorns or chocolate. He really goes more into detail here about techniques and smart kitchen practices, encouraging people to be adventurous, whereas the home cooking is mostly about keeping it simple and showing that it isn't hard to make amazing food at home and keep it stress free.		Both are fantastic and combined with some input from my mother basically taught me everything I know about cooking. Also very relaxing to watch in your spare time even when not thinking about meals.
He's only a jerk to chefs who are professionals and think they're perfect. On the shows where he works with amateur chefs who actually want to learn, he's really nice.There's no anger from Ramsay, only disappointment when he meets a chef who just struggles with cooking. 
He's only a jerk to chefs who are professionals and think they're perfect.

[Here's a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_H1-UhPm2A) where they needed to do whipped cream, and that supposedly doesn't fall out of the bowl when you flip it upside down.
I remember this episode from the UK version, where he visits some soul food restaurant in London and from the first bite he is just under a spell: you can clearly see this is some of the best he's ever had and just really feel bad for the owner not to have success because her food is 10/10 and she cooks it with a passion and high quality. Excellent episode, really think it reflects the true Gordon.He took one look at the decor and owner, sighed, then looked at the food, and sighed, saying "This plate looks really sloppy and there's too much on it." Then he started eating, and really loved the food.		He mostly got the owner to trust her cook more, then fixed up the menu so she could be profitable, did a little advertising, and it was all gravy. With extra gravy. And biscuits. With some ribs and mac and cheese.		Dammit, now I'm hungry.

That is a great story.		Also, I couldn't help but picture Chef Ramsay as Gilderoy Lockhart with the signed cookbooks.Except Ramsay has actually done everything his books claim he has ;)
You don't really get to see it a whole lot on Hell's Kitchen, but in Kitchen Nightmares you often get a glimpse of his good side.  Hard to tell how much is reality TV bullshit, but I definitely get the impression he's a really cool bloke.It's even more apparent in the British version of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares because there isn't the Fox-level of reality TV editing.

Honestly, if you really watch one of his shows, you can still see that he's a nice guy.

Even normal MasterChef is miles away from the screaming Gordon Ramsay you see on Hell's Kitchen.

However, every chef on HK is a professional chef so mistakes aren't tolerated, and those who can't handle the pressure are culled from the group.The thing with HK is, it's SO freakin' dramatic now.  I loved the first few seasons where there wasn't so much damned drama.  I watched the first 5 or 6 seasons religiously then just started falling off where I'd watch some seasons and not others.  I watched last season and the whole time thinking "Why?"  This season, the first 2 episodes and i was like "I'm done".  I won't be back.  I loved the old way they did it where the finale was broken up into 2 episodes where the first part was them designing their half of the restaurant and they could choose a great menu theme and all that.  Now it's just all sandwiched into one episode and none of the creativity comes through.		Kitchen Nightmares was sort of the same thing.  I loved it at the start but it just became super hyped up drama.  The Kitchen Nightmares (UK) is by FAR superior in every way imaginable and it looks like an entirely different show.  I rewatch those all the time too.

MasterChef Australia also has that vibe, in my opinion.

Such a dick. Christ. 		Even with context. He knows. He said in a later interview that he can't watch boiling point because he knows that he was, in his words, 'a monster.'		By all accounts, though, he's a genuinely decent person. Hell, that entire kitchen brigade that he was screaming at followed him to his new restaurant when he quit his previous job. And he made sure the restaurant was closed two days a week so that everyone got real time off and wasn't burning themselves out.
Bastard just wanted a free meal :)see, that's better!

He does have ~~three~~ four of them, so it makes sense.		You should watch his home cooking show, it's all on YT. He cooks in his own kitchen at home with his kids, and it's based on quick and easy recipes that you'll have time to make even on a hectic weekday.		Edit: totally forgot he has three girls, not two.Awesome, I'll look into it. I have a deep respect for the man and have never had one of his recipes go wrong.

I don't enjoy cooking shows, for the most part, but I love Ramsey, and it's nice to see him be himself and not the lunatic he's forced to be for ratings. It was especially fun seeing him lose a challenge to a guy who made the most disgusting looking bread pudding ever.

That last one really struck me as well, so nice around them :) the only reason for me not to watch it was how competitive many of kids are, goes to show how much that is a part of our culture>how competitive many of kids are, goes to show how much that is a part of our culture		And there's nothing wrong with that! :-D		Competition can help some of us push to heights we might never reach without it.
People know Gordon Ramsay as some sort of asshole chef on TV, but I think he's a genuinely nice person 95% of the time.Probably because on TV he's dealing with professional chefs who shouldn't be messing up their tasks (I guess? I don't watch it). 
The thing with HK is, it's SO freakin' dramatic now.  I loved the first few seasons where there wasn't so much damned drama.  I watched the first 5 or 6 seasons religiously then just started falling off where I'd watch some seasons and not others.  I watched last season and the whole time thinking "Why?"  This season, the first 2 episodes and i was like "I'm done".  I won't be back.  I loved the old way they did it where the finale was broken up into 2 episodes where the first part was them designing their half of the restaurant and they could choose a great menu theme and all that.  Now it's just all sandwiched into one episode and none of the creativity comes through.		Kitchen Nightmares was sort of the same thing.  I loved it at the start but it just became super hyped up drama.  The Kitchen Nightmares (UK) is by FAR superior in every way imaginable and it looks like an entirely different show.  I rewatch those all the time too.I'm a huge fan of Ramsay, but this is why I'm not really a fan if HK. It's too much 'Big Brother: Cooking Edition' for me. I much prefer the straight forward style of Masterchef where the focus is more on the cooking and who can make the best dish. 
I hope you know that's an edited videoIt's masterchef not masturbate.
Wrong. 		My husband said to me over thanksgiving, "I think this roast has too much garlic," and so now I'm getting a divorce. This isn't very wholesome

That may have something to do with how restaurants are allowed to be run in the different countries though. You're being blasted at for this opinion, but this really is partially it. There's a huge difference in atmospheres at the kind of restaurants he goes to. There are absolutely a few episodes of the UK version that almost feel like the US one, and it's because the restaurant and the people running it are much closer to what he deals with in the US. 		In the UK version he often gets places that are just kind of turned the wrong way, and desperately want Ramsay to come in and point them in the right direction. In the US he tends to go to places that aren't just 10 miles underground already, but the owners think they're doing nothing wrong and just want Ramsay to show up and give them free publicity. More often than not, they genuinely believe the only thing making their restaurant fail is lack of exposure. And most times Ramsay starts off completely calm and just wanting to help. It's when the owners lash out at Ramsay for 'not knowing what he's talking about' that Ramsay tends to lash out back. 
That may have something to do with how restaurants are allowed to be run in the different countries though. No. It really doesn't.
Man, GBBO is great. I'm not even really into baking but I just love how they made a competition show with a really friendly overall tone and pretty much zero drama.You obviously never watched the Baked Alaska episode of 2014...

Hey, stereotypes and generalizations aren't very wholesome. :[If we're being real for a moment, some Europeans don't realize how important our ancestors identities are here in the US because, for the most part, they've long been established in their locations. Most of us here are the product of immigration as early as a couple generations.		This cultural identity has helped build neighborhoods and the general advancement of peoples in this country. From an American to another American, it's often brought up and used as a bridge to build commonality. It's understood. But, obviously, if I was outside of the US and asked my nationality or where I'm from, of course I'd say I'm American. "You're not 'Irish American', you're American." Yeah, I know, but the Constitution of Ireland itself designates the term and offers its support.		There seems to be a snotty attitude towards it by some people on Reddit...I can understand why they react that way to a degree, because America often seems to be boisterous about claiming things as their own, but I think it's blown way out of proportion by some people. It doesn't help that Reddit is centered around America despite being a global platform.		I'm proud of my family's history. My father has done all the genealogical work to trace us back centuries. 
Ahah whyYou know		"My Great Grandpa fled this that or the other back in Italy in 1908 and here I am 4 generations later... . I live in New Jersey and I've never actually been to Italy but my Great Grandpas blood is enough for me to stake my claim".
First time I actually lol'd on redditCongrats, make sure it doesn't happen again. 
First time I actually lol'd on reddit[Here's another one, with Jaime Oliver this time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiEjs7deHL4).
good eats is so disgustingly early 2000s but it's still really informative and i love ithttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfDNi1aEljAQ17mUrfUjkvg/videos he has a youtube channel and does content for various outlets too.
Gawd how many times have I heard this on Kitchen Nightmares. Remember the restaurant owner in Texas I think who thought he was the best there was? He and Ramsay got into heated arguments like nose-to-nose. The guy raised his own beef and claimed he used it in his restaurant but as it turns out, he didn't. He bought all the meat. The guy was a tool and his restaurant closed.Isn't that the one where he served frozen fish as "fresh catch of the day"?
One of the few US shows I think we actually did worse in Britain is Pimp My Ride. Most of the shit is just far too dramatic, like you're saying. Geordie Shore is embarrassing too.British Pimp My Ride? All I can think of is mopeds with way too many  mirrors and vividly painted Reliant Robins.
They're not dumbed down though. They just have the budget to make them not suck. The Wonder Pets is a great show for you
I always think "nothing can put me in a good mood today" until I visit one of this sub's comment sections.I've been making an effort to cull out some of the more negative friends in my group for at least a few months so I can work on some aspects of my personality and man, this sub gives me hope for the future of the internet. 		*subscribes aggressively*
Awesome, I'll look into it. I have a deep respect for the man and have never had one of his recipes go wrong.> I have a deep respect for the man and **have never had one of his recipes go wrong**.		Thats not because his recipes are so great, its because you're great a making them. 
A lot of him getting angry is just for tv. In reality he seems like a pretty good person. His behavior is completely different on the UK version of kitchen nightmares vs. the US version.Also because he gets reasonably angry at adults because they are charging for a certain standard and not meeting it.

>how competitive many of kids are, goes to show how much that is a part of our culture		And there's nothing wrong with that! :-D		Competition can help some of us push to heights we might never reach without it.But it's also nice for kids to have a childhood full of joy and the stuff children are supposed to indulge in. There's enough competition and pressure as an adult. 		Edit: I agree competition is healthy, and kids should know what loss is like, but they should also have time to enjoy themselves and discover what it is that they enjoy. It's not that kids shouldn't compete, but more that society has crammed competition down their throat whether they like it or not, in every aspect of their young lives, and it's unfortunate in a lot of ways. I grew up competing, but it was because it was what I enjoyed, not because I was desperately trying to keep up. 
Probably because on TV he's dealing with professional chefs who shouldn't be messing up their tasks (I guess? I don't watch it). A lot of time, especially Nightmares America, the chefs seem to either give no fucks, or try to fight him.  In UK he has some nice genuine, sit down moments with the chefs basically saying, "If this is what you want to do, why do you don't care?"
maybe they know, but I don't. what's edited? Is the criticism from an adult's entre and then in reality Gordon told the kid 'Better luck next time'? 		i only watched one season of masterchef junior but it definitely seems ooc for him to curse or even say 'masterbate' around the kids, so i definitely believe that its edited just to be clear. Im just curious. The footage of Ramsay is from a different show, the footage of the kid is from Masterchef Junior. They're simply edited together to look like one video. I'm unsure exactly which show the Ramsay footage is from but I would assume Masterchef.
U is for you and me!N is for anywhere and anytime at all!

I've had Americans approach me telling me they're Scottish and asking me what clan I'm from, and what my tartan is, because for some stupid reason they've tracked their heritage back to some arbitrary point when that was a thing, and they still think most Scots identify with it. When truth is they're far more likely to affiliate themselves with their city or football team. 		It's frustrating because for the most part they don't actually give a shit about the country they claim they're from, just some romantic shadow of what it used to be. They just want too feel attached to something more.  
Congrats, make sure it doesn't happen again. Nah man, we lol all we want in /r/wholesomememes
British Pimp My Ride? All I can think of is mopeds with way too many  mirrors and vividly painted Reliant Robins.I actually wouldn't mind a Mod revival. 		But yeah, it was hosted by Tim Westwood, the biggest wigger in history who talks like an absolute spastic. It's awful. Like seriously, how many mods do they think they can get into a tiny European car, the shows entire premise just crumbles. Most cars ended up leaving the garage with a paint job and new sound system. Truly gripping television.

> I have a deep respect for the man and **have never had one of his recipes go wrong**.		Thats not because his recipes are so great, its because you're great a making them. I should say that when I follow the directions and they turn out how they're supposed to the flavors are good. He's really good at making sure the flavor profiles are good, nothing is overwhelming. That's on the recipes rather than me, the first time I make something I always follow the recipe exactly.
Also because he gets reasonably angry at adults because they are charging for a certain standard and not meeting it.Exactly, he can be extreme but realistically he is a big consumer advocate. He gets upset the most when restaurants have standards so low they put the customers in danger. 
Also because he gets reasonably angry at adults because they are charging for a certain standard and not meeting it.Yup. He's exceptionally angry on Hell's Kitchen because they are all professional chefs so he has higher expectations of them (well that and they edit the show to be more angry). During MasterChef he actually can be quite encouraging at the beginning; it's during the later rounds when he expects them to be better that he gets more angry. And he gets angry when the contestants are arrogant and refuse to take their advice. So I do think he's a great guy and probably a good mentor.

I played football for a long time and then boxed and even if some individual moments were awful, I loved my time doing it.

I grew up playing sports and think it's a fantastic thing for kids. Not every kid will act well in a win or a loss or during the game but that's not an indictment of competition. Sheltering kids and hiding them from all competition would be a HORRIBLE way to raise a child

So when someone *wants* to learn or needs to be taught, he appears to exert the effort to teach them.		So when someone claims to be a chef or of the profession, and they show no passion and lack of care for their product, he takes it personally. That's why he gets so upset.

You'd be surprised how just changing your vocabulary slightly can make not only yourself feel better but also the people around you		For instance: Do not say "Do you understand?" as this makes people feel like you are talking down to them, instead say "Am I explaining it clearly?"

2017 moodKinda BS though. The reason you say sorry is to acknowledge your fuck up. Saying "Thanks for waiting for me" implies that you appreciate the person waiting for you, but you have no intention to change your ways. 
2017 moodI like this. My girlfriend is always getting upset with me because I apologize too much for things I don't need to apologize for. I'll try this. :)

2017 moodThis is excellent advice for anyone with low self-esteem, anxiety, or any of that bad shit. Apologising to people makes them complicit in your negative opinion of yourself/your actions! 
2017 moodThe "thank you" implies that they're willing to put up with what you're doing-- quite the assumption. "I'm sorry" is more humble, less intrusive. It's arrogant and wrong to assert yourself in the way you plan to in 2017.

2017 moodEh, this isn't for me to be honest, it reminds me of cynical service industry weasel words to avoid any responsibility. If you have something to apologise for it's a good idea to do it, and I'd rather hear 'sorry I'm late' than 'thanks for waiting', because it's sort of a way get out of apologising.
2017 moodI don't know. This is basically saying "I've stopped apologizing for bad behavior and started thanking people for tolerating my bad behavior. And I feel so much better!"     	It's probably better to feel a little bad when you do things you shouldn't. Hopefully it will make you want to *stop doing that*. Definitely thank other people, but do it as well, not instead.

This is a really good post, thanks for sharing it! I'm going to try and take this on board in future :)This sentiment (if not exactly tumblr post) has popped up before, and I've been doing it for a few months now since I saw it.

This post is amazing!		You'd be surprised how just changing your vocabulary slightly can make not only yourself feel better but also the people around you		For instance: Do not say "Do you understand?" as this makes people feel like you are talking down to them, instead say "Am I explaining it clearly?" This just makes people feel like you are not being condescending. I need that last one! Have definitely upset a few girlfriends that way...

Kinda BS though. The reason you say sorry is to acknowledge your fuck up. Saying "Thanks for waiting for me" implies that you appreciate the person waiting for you, but you have no intention to change your ways. "Thanks for waiting for me! I had every intention to be on time but there was a wreck on the highway." Seems reasonable to me. 		"Thanks for waiting for me! I kept snoozing my alarm because I knew you'd be here no matter what." Different story. 
Kinda BS though. The reason you say sorry is to acknowledge your fuck up. Saying "Thanks for waiting for me" implies that you appreciate the person waiting for you, but you have no intention to change your ways. My girlfriend says sorry about pretty much everything, even small pointless things, so it kind of ruins the meaning of it. I don't think the person is meaning never say sorry, I think they're saying only apologize for things that actually deserve apologizing for and that you have intent to change. Cause when she apologize for having me drive over there often cause she doesn't like snow driving, or apologizes for 'making' me pay for her dinner, when those are really things I chose to do, 1: it undermines what I do for her and makes me feel unappreciated and 2: makes it so that when she apologizes for something warranted I don't feel like it's sincere and I don't feel like she intends to improve it. 
If you do this too often it's going to start sounding passive aggressive. There's nothing wrong with apologizing IMO.Time, place, tone, the people involved, all important factors to consider. :)
Eh, this isn't for me to be honest, it reminds me of cynical service industry weasel words to avoid any responsibility. If you have something to apologise for it's a good idea to do it, and I'd rather hear 'sorry I'm late' than 'thanks for waiting', because it's sort of a way get out of apologising.I think this is aimed at people who apologize for everything. I think if you're late to class or an appointment it's appropriate to apologize but if you're just a few minutes late meeting a friend for coffee or something "thanks for waiting" would be more appreciated than "sorry for being late" as it shows you don't need constant reassurance. It's for people who always feel like they're being a burden to help get them out of that frame of mind. 
I don't know. This is basically saying "I've stopped apologizing for bad behavior and started thanking people for tolerating my bad behavior. And I feel so much better!"     	It's probably better to feel a little bad when you do things you shouldn't. Hopefully it will make you want to *stop doing that*. Definitely thank other people, but do it as well, not instead.There are definitely people who compulsively apologize for things nobody really expects them to apologize for, and it just ends up making everyone kind of uncomfortable. I think this advice is more aimed at that kind of thing and not saying "never apologize ever".
Which meme exactly is this a wholesome version of?		I'm not sure I was aware of the "posting text on tumblr" meme.Not every post is a remix of another meme. I do enjoy those though :)
This sub is a mindfuck. Reinforces my view that happy people are happy because of some inside joke I'm not in on. Your daily thoughts will create your attitude, and your attitude will determine your actions! Positive goes in, positive comes out!

No job is meaningless! You provided a necessary service and earned very necessary money! But it sounds like you've found an even better job, so congrats on that! :)To add to your excellent point... It's never meaningless, you gained experience doing that job, it may not be trade skills, or learning how to program a database for example but perhaps you've learned how to deal with bad customers, decipher what managers say and what they mean etc. 		You gained experience and that's one thing that nobody can take away from you.

I think her saying sorry means she really DOES appreciate the things you do for her since she acknowledges it enough to apologize.

TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritsome of the comments are just mean. how can you be so mean?
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritI really like this sub. I was getting so tired of the constant flood of memes about depression and suicide, about how much life sucks, how being an adult sucks, how everything sucks. I get that it might help people who suffer from depression when they make stuff like that or read stuff made by others to learn that they aren't the only one who have those thoughts, but the only thing it does for the rest of us is dragging us down.
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritTotalbiscuit is my favorite person in the gaming industry, even if he is not technically part of the industry. 		His commitment to protect the consumer is like the unbreakable spirit of a superhero and I am of full belief that spirit and a healthy dose of british stubborness are what is keeping him alive well past the estimated date of his death.		Seriously, have you ever seen one of his videos when some streamer/game developer pulls a bs trick to cash in on unsuspecting/naive people? He goes from 0 to 100 rage so quickly and absolutely tears them apart. He's as close as you can get to a literal bulwark of protection for the average gamer. 		I hope that we can all learn from TB so even after he sadly passes away we can treat everything we see with skepticism and take care to protect ourselves from malicious exploiters.

Who is total biscuit? Games journalist - probably one of the most well known youtubers in the PC gaming sector. Often times has controversial opinions but he is well respected for being generally well spoken. 		Unfortunately he has had cancer for a little while though, which has sort of been looming around for a few years so he hasn't been extremely active recently. 
Who is total biscuit? He's a popular British video game Youtuber. I believe he first gained popularity as an e-sports caster for SC2. 
Who is total biscuit? A Youtuber I believe, does a lot of PC gaming if I recall.
Who is total biscuit? A standup guy
He's my friends neighbor!Wow! What a small world! Glad that I can share it with interesting people like you fine folks!!
I just gotta say. I was having a horrible Christmas and I've been browsing this sub and you guys have made me do a 180. Thanks.I stumbled through the doors of r/wholesomememes not too long ago, started with the whole "there's a larger joke at play here, right?", "wait, are they seriously this nice..?", "Oh, why that's just really nice I think I'll upvote that kind person"		It takes a friendly sub like this to show you things can be nice on the internet, and they're just fucking lovely through n through haha
Can I say one thing		Why the hate and these removed comment :,("e-celeb". (no pr guy between him and the public for the longest of times. like have you met the public? we are crazy hard to deal with) has the equivalent for arguments as "resting bitch face" it seems. like i personally don't see it but thats my current best guess. It's like he could say "I don't enjoy meatboy because i'm terrible at 2d platformers" and the internet would go "HE THINKS MEATBOY IS SO BAD YOU SHOULD KILL KITTENS!!!" ... it's weird. dude isn't without his faults but who the fuck is? 
Can I say one thing		Why the hate and these removed comment :,(I haven't read said comments, but I'm guessing that he has opinions, and some people can't live with that. Just like happiness; some people can't live with the happiness of others.
I thought he quit social media. Is he back?Hes like the tide, you see. 
Wait, didn't he say he something like he wanted to leave the toxic reddit community forever a while back?		But then again, didn't he say that a couple of times already..?Social media is a hard thing to cut out completely, particularly when you're also trying to stay engaged in an active industry like gaming. The ol' boy is doing what he can.
I don't agree with him generally and sincerely I think it may be a marketing move since most youtubers rely on their online presence but I wish him a merry christmas anyway.I don't think you know him well enough if that's what you think about this
Is there a graph of the subs for this month caus im pretty sure it's been blowing up[Here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/about/traffic/)
You added an extra meIt's *really* fun to type
You added an extra meThe extra Me stands for Me-Y-O-Me-Me. 
You added an extra meI wanted to include youu. ;)
You added an extra meSorry, I bit my tongue. 
You added an extra "me", but that reminds me of the Great Mighty Poo from Conker's Bad Fur Day, and that makes me happy. :)That game is NOT wholesome, but whatever makes you happy!
Even if I don't always agree with his opinions I'll always respect him for being so aggressively pro consumer and fighting the video game industry for better treatment of players. Agree or disagree, but at least you can always see where he's coming from
Wait what i dont use twitter and i havent watched tb in a while. I am so far out of loop. this has really thrown me off. I'm actually crying right now. I cant believe i missed this! :( dear lord i'm so dang sorry for him and Genna. My heart will forever go out to them both. We know for two years now.

I cant believe i missed this! :( dear lord i'm so dang sorry for him and Genna. My heart will forever go out to them both. Genna also found out she has some sort of uterine tumor, IIRC 
Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. 
Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(I'm not necessarily! Metastatic liver cancer is not often cured (rarely). I have not seen his current updates but as of the 30th of november it has not spread and is shrunk by over 50%. From the size of 5cm to 2cm. We can still hold faith. Metastatic cancer is tough to beat but it isnt impossible. He is a strong man, a stubborn man. I he has a chance to beat it. My grandfather had pancreatic cancer (a 92.3% mortality rate) and beat it. He did pass later however due to old age and a weakened immune system due to the chemo and radiation therapy. tb is young and has a fighting chance. 
Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(Maybe he will be the first!
Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(I thought that his treatments were shrinking the tumor?
Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(When did this happen? Thought it was like 30% survival but the majority of people who got this cancer are like 80+ so his chances are way better, beyond that I thought it was in remission
Weirdly, I see /r/me_irl as positive - it's like people realise they aren't quite cutting it, but are willing to take the piss out of themselves."life fucking sucks but at least we can laugh at it and keep going"
Weirdly, I see /r/me_irl as positive - it's like people realise they aren't quite cutting it, but are willing to take the piss out of themselves.I think this place has been rubbing off on reddit. Either that or it is a general trend of positivity on reddit. It might just be that Reddit is getting less mean after election season. But I kind of doubt it as I still see politics everywhere and even when I agree with the jerk politics right now is toxic. Regardless this sub is doing good work.

He's a gaming critic.

We know for two years now.Well two years i havent seen a video of his nor read his twitter. It happens. I love the man but i just fell out of loop. I stopped watching youtube late 2013 and only started watching it again regularly again about 6 months ago as i found more free time to do so dropping a second job. 
Genna also found out she has some sort of uterine tumor, IIRC just tumors iirc it looked like it wasn't cancer
Genna also found out she has some sort of uterine tumor, IIRC Damn, didn't there kid have a tumor too? Seriously bad luck for those guys hoped they pull through
According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.
According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. Maybe he can keep his luck up :D
According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. >According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago.		This is simply not true. He was given a ~3 year prognosis upon discovering the metastasis less than 3 years ago. That is not "should have been dead a long time ago."		He's shared some positive developments since then, but nothing at the level of a Christmas miracle like you describe.		**EDIT:** correction - he never actually revealed any prognosis - ~3 years is just the average lifespan for those diagnosed with his condition. It's really unfortunate, but liver metastasis is still basically a death sentence, even in 2016 :(		Of course, we're *all* technically terminal anyway... It should also be noted that most people who are diagnosed with liver metastasis are much, *much* older than TB. His youth definitely doesn't hurt his chances, but it's still an incredibly awful illness.		I'd also like to point out that we all ought to learn from this. TB confessed that he had had bloody stool for several months before he actually went and got it checked out. Had he gone immediately, who knows what would've happened. Moral of the story is, if your body is doing something really weird/bad, **get it checked out**. 
According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. It's hard to tell- his variety of cancer primarily afflicts people who are much older, so it's very hard to know how bad it will affect him

Yup, for almost a year, maybe longer. About 2 years actually
You mean the charity stream that he tried to help by linking it on twitter and the person running the stream decided that TB putting out a link was tantamount to ruining everything do he shut down the stream in a hissy fit instead if jusy letting TBs followers help the charity?Yep, that's the one.
"life fucking sucks but at least we can laugh at it and keep going":)		Most positive look at meirl I've seen. I always saw this sub as the natural response to meirl's excessive depression memes.
I think this place has been rubbing off on reddit. Either that or it is a general trend of positivity on reddit. It might just be that Reddit is getting less mean after election season. But I kind of doubt it as I still see politics everywhere and even when I agree with the jerk politics right now is toxic. Regardless this sub is doing good work.True.  		I am a perfect example... 		I just saw some idiot trolling about politics on Twitter and thought about taking the bait and even had my reply typed out, but deleted it, closed the window, and came here instead.  	I came back to 4 positive messages.  		It appears people are bored to hell with shitting on each other, and what's the point? It has no real effect - just increases blood pressure levels.

Nope, he started with wow pvp videos, and then moved to sc2.Oh yeah, he did some stuff with the Yogscast way back when.
There's a different subset of people that hate him for joining in on the Gamergate nonsense. Telling his twitter followers to harass MovieBob, saying that fiction should never have politics in it, bloviating endlessly about hating Antia Sarkeesian and victim blaming her when she received credible death threats, etc. 		edit: I don't play the same types of games as TB so I only hear about him when he's being a shitheel. He could be as pure as Mr. Rogers outside of that for all I know. i recognise the events you are referring to but your interpretation leaves me so dumbfounded i dunno what to reply. like a "just dispassionately try to look at those things again while assuming straight up good intentions or atleast no malice on his part as a thought experiment" is the only thing i can come up with that'll be in the spirit of this sub. Like i honestly just don't understand your perspective. i'm most cerainly biased but if you want to get into a good natured argument about specifics feel free to pm me since this sub isn't really about that.

Glad everyone is enjoying it. :) Indeed so ty kindly.

You're naive if you think gamers aren't treated like shit by many publishers and developers Don't lose sight of wholesomeness guys : )

TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.Cancer doesn't have a high enough FOV setting to kill TB. 
TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.TB's so ~~stubborn~~ committed to living a full and happy life that he won't let even cancer keep him down.
TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.His cancer is only 30fps, it isn't fast enough to kill him.		Well, if it was on a screen, watching it in 30fps would.
TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.So cynical, even the cancer isn't sure if it exists. 
TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.He got cancer, but he dropped it.
it's colon cancer, not liver. not the same prognosis... sadly.The colon cancer went into remission i think? his new tumor is metastatic located in the liver iirc (metastatic is reallllllly rough anywhere. Particularly in the liver). Colon cancer has a fairly good survival rate when it comes to hope. Liver however isnt as good but it still is better than say, pancreatic cancer at a low 8% chance of survival due to an incredibly low detection rate. The biggest thing is stages. I'm not sure how long it took to detect his colon cancer but i know the metastatic growth was detected quick but those things grow QUICK. As previously said from what i could find, the end of november held news of the good sort. I went from devistated hearing of this for the first time today to trying to find all i can about his status. I'm not saying he'll be the one to beat it to hell but his current status could prove to keep him going for at least a while longer. When he was diagnosed he was given 2-3 years. Not sure if that changed. 		And colon cancer is far more curable than liver cancers. 		I honestly would cry myself to sleep for weeks knowing my life was given 3 years shelf life. I cant imagine the pain he feels, the emotions he suffers through. He is a good man in my opinion. Of course i'm being optimistic but a man can have hope. 
I hope he canThe first of many!

I came back to 4 positive messages.  		It appears people are bored to hell with shitting on each other, and what's the point? It has no real effect - just increases blood pressure levels.This is so true. Every time something negative occurs, I've been working very hard not to have that instant knee jerk reaction. Be it shopping, or driving or reading comments/posts. It's not always easy, but I always feel better for it, even if it takes me a bit to realize it. 
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad He recently cited how CODs new single player is far better than BF1, and how COD is getting unfair shit for doing the same stuff over and over while they've been innovating and BF1 is pretty much just a reskin of BF4, which upset a lot of people. He didn't say Infinite warfare is good, which a lot of people took it as, just that he thought it was stupid how much praise  BF was getting. 		That's just one of the things, but it's all similar.
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad I'm guessing his various opinions on games, etc. Nothing too controversial. Unless you happen to be fan of said game, the Titanfall 2 Single-Player springs to mind. 
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad I'm not the one you asked but over the last year+ I have watched his videos not much controversial came up. Maybe only a thing about the presidential election, trump and stuff. 
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad Personally my only disagreements with his opinions have been about game play occasionally he'll dislike something I enjoy in a game or vice versa, but I know a lot of people disagreed with his opinions an "gamer-gate" and that's the biggest controversy I can think of off the top of my head. 
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad TB doesn't mind cosmetic micro transactions that are available at launch. He doesn't defend them but he says they are fine. I personally disagree with that. He defended overwatches progression system. 		Thats about it for me. Still a very sane man and he is still objective so I don't have to give a shit what he thinks, he informs me and I know what to think. 
Oh yeah, he did some stuff with the Yogscast way back when.He is the person who got the yogscast started lmao
It's a typo.Its just a happy little mistake :)
Don't lose sight of wholesomeness guys : )I'm trying. Might have to move the argument to pms:p
He did, but Orion is apparently quite fine.i like that name
Do they collect uranium or something? Why the fuck are they all getting tumors and cancer?His job is on the internet. That's usually a good source of the latter.
Cancer doesn't have a high enough FOV setting to kill TB. Cancer is the true peasant.
Cancer doesn't have a high enough FOV setting to kill TB. Nah, he has Heart, CranK, Alicia, and Ryung 4v1ing cancer. Its the real reason Axiom was disbanded.
Cancer doesn't have a high enough FOV setting to kill TB. Surely you mean it doesn't have a low enough FoV? 
TB's so ~~stubborn~~ committed to living a full and happy life that he won't let even cancer keep him down.And he won't, back down.
Jesus, how many people have this horrible disease...My aunt just passed away from it. Cancer is very common, sadly. Someone you know will be afflicted by it in your life before you're 30, unfortunately.		The thing with bowel cancer (and most internal cancers of the digestive tract) is that they aren't as glamourous to market awareness.		Even testicular cancer is hard to raise awareness.		Breast cancer is easy to market awareness to both sexes, and even cervical cancer is easy to raise awareness (because most women go to an OB/GYN.)		Colon cancer, rectal cancer, etc. is hard to market merchandise concerning at.		"Feel your Boobies" is easy.		"Get a Barium enema and an x-ray" is hard. 
Better luck mutating next time, cancer.YouTube commenter here, my bad.
I'm guessing his various opinions on games, etc. Nothing too controversial. Unless you happen to be fan of said game, the Titanfall 2 Single-Player springs to mind. people are always butthurt if someone doesn't like the game/movie/music they like, people who make these things part of personality that is and don't realize that these things are subjective.	
I'm not the one you asked but over the last year+ I have watched his videos not much controversial came up. Maybe only a thing about the presidential election, trump and stuff. Is he Pro Trump or anti Trump? I have stopped following him since a year or so.

He defended overwatches progression system. 		Thats about it for me. Still a very sane man and he is still objective so I don't have to give a shit what he thinks, he informs me and I know what to think. the overwatch cosmetic discussion is an interesting one, I don't disagree with either wide but lean towards it being ok just because I have most skins I want at level 102, game was 33% cheaper than most triple A titles, and game is getting free content updates
Its just a happy little mistake :)A happy...me-stake.
Cancer is the true peasant.And thusly the secret is found as to why cancer will never beat TB.
Nah, he has Heart, CranK, Alicia, and Ryung 4v1ing cancer. Its the real reason Axiom was disbanded.Cancer's got strong micro but the macro just aint there
Surely you mean it doesn't have a low enough FoV? Higher FOV = able to see more on-screen		Cancer can't see TB
And he won't, back down.Flashbacks to Barnyard. Great movie.
And he won't, back down.THERES TOO MUCH AT STAKE
And he won't, back down.You can stand him up at the gates of hell, but he won't back down.
> everyone on reddit is an oncologist now ?		> isn't an oncologistThere is so little self awareness in his post I can't even handle it
It's metastasized to his liver from his bowl. Oh no. I've never had my bowl checked for cancer :(		How do they do that, like, an x-ray?
Is he Pro Trump or anti Trump? I have stopped following him since a year or so.Very anti-Trump		https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5c0iza/totalbiscuit_quits_reddit_citing_trumps_intent_to/
Is he Pro Trump or anti Trump? I have stopped following him since a year or so.Anti Trump, pretty strongly. I wasn't watching at the moment, but I think he had a big out-burst about it online, he chilled out apparently and I think he apologized, and to be fair - as an immigrant to the United States who has cancer; a President who's probably going to have an impact on healthcare in the US isn't the best thing to have happen. But there's a load of specifics there I don't know about and would rather not get into - I just hope everything turns out OK for everyone involved.
Is he Pro Trump or anti Trump? I have stopped following him since a year or so.not American or Russian so statistically speaking anti-Trump
Was the Yogscast not a WoW guild originally in which Simon and Lewis made all of the videos?They might have been in TB's guild, but I'm pretty sure tb got them started on youtube and into the tgs network
Higher FOV = able to see more on-screen		Cancer can't see TBI guess so, I was trying to hint at low FoV being bad but that works
You can stand him up at the gates of hell, but he won't back down.He will, stand. His. Ground. And he, wont, back down
not American or Russian so statistically speaking anti-TrumpStatistically speaking most Americans are anti trump.
I guess so, I was trying to hint at low FoV being bad but that worksOhh right I didn't even think of that
Makes sense but each and everything is deleted or removed now. I wanted to see TB's perspective. I believe this was his last post on the matter	https://www.twitch.tv/totalbiscuit/p/126163861478820597
Not really.I know this isn't the place for it but, statistically speaking, yeah. He lost the popular vote and is entering his presidency with the lowest approval rating of anyone. So, statistically and factually speaking...yeah.

Edit: Thanks for proving my point, Reddit.What's this you've said to me, my good friend? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and I've been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.

Edit: Thanks for proving my point, Reddit.True that. I just got 3800 upvotes on a comment the other day (my highest ever) for simply saying "wait'll you see what 2017 will be like."

His awkward, too-intense stare watches over us all.I don't think his smile is awkward, quite frankly it's beautiful. 		Edit: I just realized you said stare instead of smile, I apologize. I use a reddit app and forgot what you had said. I hope you have a fantastic day!
His awkward, too-intense stare watches over us all.As someone with a non-controllable intense stare, thank you for making me feel special.

Sometimes you're a stranger to yourself, so 5 strangers can be technically correct, I think.I sometimes wonder if even I know who I am, so I suppose that's true

My name is Katy but you can also call me the penguin of wholesomeness! As you can see I'm very nice! That's why I came here, to meet more nice people like me.

She's nice too, but I want to meet more nice people, because like they say: The more nice people the more happy people.

What's this you've said to me, my good friend? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and I've been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner.

Hell, I shitpost to specifically make people's days. Even if they downvote i bet them downvoting it gave them a little dopamine boost (:We all know that most redditors downvote to disagree - you're just giving them an opportunity to share their feelings and opinions. Thanks for taking one for the team! 
True that. I just got 3800 upvotes on a comment the other day (my highest ever) for simply saying "wait'll you see what 2017 will be like." Took me three seconds to come up with that masterpiece. wait'll you see what 2017 will be like.					^^^^will ^^^^it ^^^^work

We are all strangers to ourselves in some ways What a ridiculously overly positive and ultimately very accurate statement. Like, it's really silly, but I also gain a new perspective at the same time. You guys are pretty cool here!

Don't worry, you're not dumb, you just made a mistakeVery true. No one is from the dumdum factory as long as they are willing to ask and learn.
I found this sub a few days ago! The positivity is almost surreal, and I love it here.Me too :)
It sure is!Thanks for pointing that out, friend!
IT'S OVER 9,000!They've gone to wholesome speed! 
Thank you for pointing that out, I made a small leap of judgement sorryIt's ok friend, jumping to conclusions helps us make time sensitive decisions faster so it doesn't have to be a bad thing.

Wholesome lieThat's such a sweet idea! I'm not one for lying but I'm definitely gonna try something like this the next time someone meets my dogs.
Wholesome lieMe: "Oh wow, he usually runs and hides when new people come over. He must like you!"			Every date I've ever brought home: "Aww, what a sweetie!" 			Kitty cat: *headbutts incessantly, oblivious to the mischaracterisation*

Wholesome lieThat was really nice. Thanks OP <@:)
Wholesome lieMy cat always runs and greets people. He's awesome. 		Getting my cat was the best choice ever. And the next best was taking a little bit of everyday just to play and hang out with him. 		He's a solo indoor kitty. But he's super friendly. 		I love my cat :) 
Wholesome lieThat's so sweet. I tell people my cat doesn't really like people because I want to be honest with them and I don't want them to get hurt because he can at times be extremely violent. I still love him though he's a wonderful boy. 
Wholesome lieMy dog likes literally everyone but I always tell them that it's weird how she takes a shine to certain people 
Wholesome liemy dogs a jerk, so i tell people that so when she nips at them they don't feel that bad, am i doing it right?
Wholesome lieaka a white-lie. Right? 
Wholesome liey would u lie tho
Wholesome lieJust like telling someone they're pretty when they're not.  It doesn't hurt anyone!  	  	My problem with this is that it doesn't take into consideration whether a person would want you to lie to them; it doesn't give them a choice.  It's patronizing and condescending.

I love when celebrities are starstruckI actually saw Aaron Paul at a concert I went to. He was roped off in a VIP section a few feet away.

Make Happy seriously changed my outlook on life. Aaron isn't exaggerating, it's really that good. Cool to see to of my favorite celebs being bros. I'm just super easily emotionally influenced, and I downloaded Make Happy from Netflix to watch during a flight. I felt really sad after it because I was just thinking about how sad he was and how the issues he mentioned are so personal to him.

Which one is the celebrity?Both are, Aaron Paul is an actor who got a lot of recognition when he played Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad. Bo Burnham is a stand-up comedian and singer/songwriter, with the two roles often overlapping. He has a couple stand-up specials on Netflix, most recently ~~"What"~~ "Make Happy" and also "What", which is the special Aaron Paul is referring to :) 
woah, cool. 		^^ that's all I had to add.You're cool, thanks for your addition.
Who's Aaron Paul?Jesse bitch.  	  	Edit: In all seriousness he played Jesse Pinkman, Walter White's assistant in crime on Breaking Bad. His character is known for being profane and saying "bitch" a lot. 
True ;)I love you
What's a whole so me meme?hole so may maymay? idk. But something good, undoubtedly!
Who was performing?Jack Garratt. Really talented artist, would highly recommend!

"What." is probably the best stand-up special I've ever seen. The cinematography is outstanding. I'm so impressed by it. I don't even compare it to "stand-up." 		That shit is an amazing hour long preformance, a one-man show.

I love Make Happy and What. I like to listen to his songs a lot too, they're really creative :)No one can quite go from insane hilarity to getting real with the feels like Bo. 		The wide range of emotions I feel watching his specials is insane and unlike any other comedy special I've ever seen. 		It's insane how good he is for such a young age. I think he knows how to handle himself properly like an experience comic but understands the humour young people look for because of his age. 
Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous is still one of my favorite shows. So many laugh out loud moments.Bo got screwed. He was on MTV at a weird point and everyone started transitioning to Netflix / cable cutting. 
[Not everything is very wholesome tho](https://youtu.be/ByC8sRdL-Ro)Nah, that song's true message, which is "Don't listen to celebrities who tell you what to do. Only you can be you.", is very wholesome. It's just presented in an unwholesome manner.
I'm just super easily emotionally influenced, and I downloaded Make Happy from Netflix to watch during a flight. I felt really sad after it because I was just thinking about how sad he was and how the issues he mentioned are so personal to him. After that I rewatched certain parts of the performance and it just became a really wholesome performance for me. Like it's real, emotional, funny, relatable, and I could even learn from it!		Make Happy didn't make me happy, it made me a more complete person.Watch the interviews he did when he was promotiing it
maybe todd could have another shot at his rock opera? I would watch a Bo Burnham written, Aaron Paul performed rock opera on it's own. Pairing it alongside Bojack's animating team would probably destroy all other comedy and sci Fi for me.

The voice actor for Todd in BoJack HorsemanTodd is my favourite character from BoJack, but I think half of it is because I just picture Jesse from Breaking Bad doing the crazy stuff Todd does.		Man I love Todd
The voice of Nyx from the Final Fantasy XV movieThe movie is basically a two hour fight scene - and he managed to make his character very likeable.		Not an easy feat!
I may not agree with you, but I appreciate your opinion! :) This is the best sub on Reddit.   :)

I don't even compare it to "stand-up." 		That shit is an amazing hour long preformance, a one-man show.Fuck. Guess I'm getting high and watching this shit again. For the hundredth time. Dammit why does he have to be so fucking funny. 
I don't even compare it to "stand-up." 		That shit is an amazing hour long preformance, a one-man show.That's because it's more akin to an established different sort of comedy that is very popular in my country (the Netherlands). It is called cabaret and one of the most well-known performers of the genre in my country (Hans Teeuwen) has actually been mentioned over and over again by Bo Burnham as one of his influences.		I really would go as far as to say it isn't stand-up, it definitely isn't from my point of view because he does almost exactly what a lot of cabaret performers have been doing in my country for at least the past 2-3 decades. Though Bo certainly injects his American 2016 stand-up flavour into the mix.		I love Bo greatly for that, for finally introducing the states to it. And because his shows are just great ofcourse :)		
Man, have you seen his original "Words, Words, Words" show?		That. Was. Fucking. Incredible.		Legitimately groundbreaking.		"What." is okay. Actually its very enjoyable. But it doesn't compare with the magic of the original :(Is it worth watching the original after watching What.?
Man, have you seen his original "Words, Words, Words" show?		That. Was. Fucking. Incredible.		Legitimately groundbreaking.		"What." is okay. Actually its very enjoyable. But it doesn't compare with the magic of the original :(My favorite show so far is definitely "Make Happy" 
I really appreciated the finale of Make Happy more when I heard it helped him overcome his anxiety and stuff when he performsIt's one of my most favorite pieces of art ever. Few things made me think and feel and hurt and laugh and relate so intensely as it did. 
I really appreciated the finale of Make Happy more when I heard it helped him overcome his anxiety and stuff when he performsAgreed, that is the only ending to a comedy performance that I've ever seen that isn't supposed to be funny. It's really well done and introspective. Really gives you insight into Bo as a human being and not just a guy telling jokes. 
I really appreciated the finale of Make Happy more when I heard it helped him overcome his anxiety and stuff when he performsThat ending hit.  me.  hard.		Seriously.  I watched it really early in the morning before the sun came up.  After it was done, I noticed that it was almost dawn and the sun was on its way up.  I then took an hour long walk just trying to get my head together as the day began.  It was like a religious experience.
I found Make Happy to be very depressing, but a great piece of work. I absolutely loved it. That show made me feel all sorts of feelings I wasn't expecting. It was this weird sort of sad insight into his emotions while still obviously being guarded because it was a performance but still at the same time ahhhh!		In the end though, it did make me happy. Thanks, Bo. I hope you're happy too.
I like you too, friend.I am your friend, buddy.

Yeah, I came back to say this as I just finished watching it.  It's definitely not the best stand up comedy I've ever seen.  I hardly laughed, the audience never really fell apart with laughter.  There's a few chuckles here and there with a bunch of cheering and clapping from a supportive crowd(because he's gay).		I enjoyed it though, it was a good performance.  That's what it was: a performance with a comedic plot.		I'm a huge stand up comedy fan, I watch them pretty	much every night before I fall asleep.  This doesn't really fit exactly within the genre of stand up comedy.		Edit: so I was incorrect that he's gay, my bad.  Doesn't change the fact that he's not funny and the majority of his audience wasn't laughing.Yes, people are only supportive of Bo Burnham because he's gay. Yep. You're not making any incorrect assumptions, no siree.  He's wildly popular only because he has a "supportive audience." Yep. Good job.

Is it worth watching the original after watching What.?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh676AbLjbw		Give it a go. Its a bit different because it wasn't designed for video like his later shows.
Is it worth watching the original after watching What.?100% I watched what first fell in love with his content and then looked for more. Words has a crazy cool concept I've never seen in stand up and really was awesome after watching what. 		I managed to see make happy live which was amazing and having that on Netflix was awesome. What will always be my favorite but jt was my first taste of his comedy which is incredible. 
My favorite show so far is definitely "Make Happy" That performance made me weep like a new born baby.		Seriously, I was not prepared for the existential crisis that it gave me.  After I was done watching it, I took an hour long walk and just....walked in silence.
That show made me feel all sorts of feelings I wasn't expecting. It was this weird sort of sad insight into his emotions while still obviously being guarded because it was a performance but still at the same time ahhhh!		In the end though, it did make me happy.

It is strange to think how much energy we can waste on negativity when it is so much easier and healthier to be positive about things.

This is the first year in a long time that NY doesn't feel like an abstract thing, this year has felt like a project that I have finally brought to a close. Better mental health, employment, new and old friends entered my life. 		I hope the next year is kind to you all.

I'm really liking the positivity people are having for 2017. /r/wholesomememes really came around at a good time.  There's a lot of large, very publicized reasons for people to be cynical and that makes it difficult to deal with the little struggles we all have going on.		I'm going to [defer to Tolkien](https://mythsofthemirror.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/gandalf-quote.jpg) on why /r/wholesomememes is important.
I'm really liking the positivity people are having for 2017. 17's a good number. That was the age I was when I had my first kiss.
I'm really liking the positivity people are having for 2017. Thanks Lucio 
I'm really liking the positivity people are having for 2017. I had tons of positivity in 2016, and I'll keep it up even though I know 2017 is going to be tough for a lot of people.
I'm really liking the positivity people are having for 2017. I have my own little multireddit set up that has all the [active] happy subs I have found. 
I'm really liking the positivity people are having for 2017. A few days ago, I had a random conversation with a stranger in an elevator.  We ended up agreeing that 2016 was pretty shitty and wished each other a happy new year.  As I walked away, something about that made me realize that we each really do have the ability to work to make 2017 better.		No, there's little we can do about celebrities dying.  But there are plenty of things we can work on to make our own lives better and make things better for our families, our communities, our nations and the world.		I know this is "obvious" and "trite", but I'm really taking a lesson from the shit-show of 2016 that there are lots of small things to work towards and ways each of us can work together to nudge things in better directions.
I'm really liking the positivity people are having for 2017. Me too. While the fuck 2016 stuff may have been some confirmation bias I hope it leads to people making a concentrated effort to make this year better for everyone :) 		Attitude goes a very long way. Everyone was so down on 2016 that every little problem became a huge problem. Let's reverse that this year and make every little success a huge one!
Happy New Year bud. I hope 2017 can counteract the negativity that seems to have seeped into the world. Here's to fresh starts, good people, and healing for the worldI just ate some dumplings.  2017 is starting off well!

I had no clue the rest of the world was having similar problems. Here's hoping these issues and fractures start to heal in 2017!Brazil was extremely divided this year. In my 30 years I've never seen anything quite like it. The reason is because (now former)President Roussef, the nation's first female president, was impeached and ousted. It was very stressful for Brazilian society because a huge part of the population loved her and identified with the left (she is a center-left politician), and over half of the voters elected her after all. But on the other hand many Brazilians loath her, mostly for either real or perceived involvement in corruption scandals. The latter rejoiced with her ousting, the former accused all of it of being a right wing undemocratic coup. People have been having lots of inflammable conversations about it, putting friends and family against one another. There have been violent protests on the streets too. All over Latin America countries picked a side in this crisis.		It was really a shame. I don't intend to pass my own judgement on it here. i just wanted to answer your question by saying that, from where I see, this has been the most divisive year for modern Brazilian society that I can recall.

This then caused Scotland to have some independent movements again, which is more division. Nothing as serious as in the USA however.  	   	Have a good day!

One of the things I absolutley love about this place is that its apolitical, we should guard against that changing.

PVV is probably going to come first in March, but it wasn't born in 2016, it's been growing in popularity for a while.

The Dutch clearly do care about international politics too, and the wall is a clear reference, bizarre that you'd deny it. To be fair, I'm an american who has had dozens of conversations about the wall and I didn't see that as the implication of the comic. I saw it as more about political divisiveness, especially with the people arguing over a divide. 		I'm guessing the artist would have gone a different route for the people and how they were interacting if he intended to target the broder wall.

Besides that taking the word "walls" literally is pretty naive as it is just as much referencing the Dutch idiom with the same words.

When it rains, it pours. Power through and you will see the sun.Everyone needs to be reminded of this some times. Thank you. 
I think that highly depends on what the topic is. If the topic is "let's gas the Jews" then sure, it would be very hard to remain polite. The problem is that even the ones who intend to commit genocide rarely say so, and those who vote for them don't think they will, really. And in those situations, for the majority of  voters who are not insane or psychopaths, there are ways of reaching out and listening is one of them. Listening, being calm and bringing facts in a polite conversation without name calling.
Absolutely, and that is a great sentiment. But if you try to turn wholesomememes into the place for fixing our broken political system, then you'll destroy its purpose.It's not just about the US. It's about the world. Tones have changed for the harsher everywhere, in France where I live and in Sweden where I come from as well. This general sentiment of reaching out and talking instead of shouting at each other behind a wall is a great and necessary sentiment. I don't see it as bringing any specific politics into the subreddit, at all.

Impress the kid from the start.When I was born, a close friend of my parent's showed up to the hospital in a nice dress shirt and tie and just generally looking put together. This was only weird because my parents and their friends were dirty hippie climbers. Mom said he obviously wasn't sure how to act but made the adorable decision to go completely against his usual grody self and clean up for the occasion. This pic reminds me of that story. Both are too cute.

It's great when the oldest tries to write back and spells my RL name phonetically as "chraavis" 		 But when I do go back I show up out of the blue with gifts and crappy magic tricks that only a kid would love and they (my nephews, ages 5, 6, and 1.5) are always happy to see me.    		I always try to make my visits with them memorable.  We go on adventures, we've been to ball pits, waterparks, corn mazes, and if it rains we break out the nerf guns or lego.   I just try to keep it fun.  Obviously the youngest doesn't take part yet but he's seen how great it is and I am sure between bottle and nap time he is thinking about getting in on it.		I try to be a role model and use my manners around them and remain positive even if someone falls down or Mom and Dad have an argument in earshot of us. While I hope some of it sticks with them I can understand if it gets lost in all the fun.		Then of course when time comes to fly home I board my flight with tears in my eyes and my nephews can return to regular lives and think about the next time Uncle default-client comes to visit. 
Impress the kid from the start.this is awesome
Impress the kid from the start.On the other hand, The baby might not leave so good an impression. Not only will he not be wearing a suit, he will also be naked and covered in blood and fluid and probably in a pretty bad mood. I hope it won't reflect poorly on him in the future 
Impress the kid from the start.Awww
Impress the kid from the start.This made my day. 		Good on ya, uncle. 
Impress the kid from the start.Remember, eye contact and a firm handshake.
Impress the kid from the start.Whenever I meet a newborn for the first time, I shake their hand and formally introduce myself. You never know if they're gonna grow up to be important, and I want to get in on the ground floor.
Impress the kid from the start.Her brother looks like ~~Plop~~ Dwight Jr. from The Office 		Edit: got the 2 customer service reps mixed up
Impress the kid from the start.Haha I'm sure he also is thinking that those Instagram/Facebook pictures will be around forever, so might as well look awesome! ;)
Impress the kid from the start.Yeah but I bet that kid shows up naked and screaming incoherently. He's probably drunk. What's going on with kids these day? 
Impress the kid from the start.For a while my things were bicycles and I would collect odd types of bike because they're so much fun. I was working at my job (Universal Studios in Orlando) when my sister went into labor (about 6 years ago). 		I biked to my house in a hurry in a 70s Bianchi foldable bike I got off craigslist for like $70. If you know about bikes, you know that 10 inch rims are not meant for long distance. 		I was so excited, after I got ready I decided to bike to the hospital as a gift to my nephew. I wouldn't pollute in his name. So I got ready then I biked to downtown Orlando in a matter of minutes. 		I was sweating and crying the whole way. I was so excited that the bike was the perfect way to relieve all the energy I had. I'm tearing up just thinking about it. Holding him in my arms and seeing his eyes made me feel a type of happiness I've never experienced. LSD, shrooms, a few other psychedelics, weed, alcohol, sex. Nothing compared to that.		So happy this guy has so much dedication/consideration for his family. 
Impress the kid from the start.Seems all my family members are basically shitty, so this is especially cool for me to see.

Definitely going to be the cool uncleWhat kind of uncles are there? My sister had a baby some months ago and i'm looking forward to become the coolest kind of them all
Definitely going to be the cool uncleI'd be pretty happy if my Uncle was Drew Carey.
When I was born, a close friend of my parent's showed up to the hospital in a nice dress shirt and tie and just generally looking put together. This was only weird because my parents and their friends were dirty hippie climbers. Mom said he obviously wasn't sure how to act but made the adorable decision to go completely against his usual grody self and clean up for the occasion. This pic reminds me of that story. Both are too cute.I really enjoyed reading this, thanks for sharing!

Being an uncle is hands down the best experience I've had. 		 Most of my family lives in Saskatchewan while I reside on the west coast so I only see them every year or two. 		If I can't make it out to visit I mail them a written letter and send out gifts for birthdays and Christmas.

It means so much to have good positive loving family like you.

I wonder if that actually works?		I mean, I know babies don't record memories at that age, but they are generating brain cells at a faster rate than any other point in their lives, and the direction those cells generate in is influenced by their experience, so maybe it will actually do something.		Something inperceptable by the child, even when they grow up but a subtle influence from a forgotten time.And most of all, his attitude about family and his responsibility and excitement about being an uncle just bleeds from the screen - kids know who is down and who's not from such an early age. This guy has it right. My parents always told me, "start as you mean to go on." Perfect example!
Seems all my family members are basically shitty, so this is especially cool for me to see.I'm not shitty and we can be family. 
What kind of uncles are there? My sister had a baby some months ago and i'm looking forward to become the coolest kind of them allI'm the "fun" uncle to my niece and nephew. I take a three pronged approach.		1) Buy them the loudest gifts possible. Kids love noise. Especially if they can push a button to make it.		2) Kids love wrestling, being upside down, and flying through the air. When they're small, throw them around as much as possible. Throw them on couches. Throw them in the water. Grab them by the ankles and hold them up like a fish you just caught. Or put them over your head and run around the room (or if you're over six feet like me, outside is better, less lamps)		3) Argue with them. get their name and age wrong.

He just doesn't care		Edit: not referring to people who are busy but make an effort when they see their nieces and nephews. In my own personal experience, I've had uncles who will only talk to me if i start the conversation and even then, only talk about the weather or the route they drove to get there. They worked 9-5 factory jobs or were retired and their kids were grown. They just preferred to sit there and drink their beer than have anything to do with me.

Be the last kind!Mine doesn't quite fit into that. My favourite uncle was a chaplain in the RAF, and whenever he would be stationed somewhere he would get gifts for us. He was incredibly kind, and even when he had progressed very far in his cancer he never stopped smiling. I asked him once why he seemed so young even though he was in his seventies, and he said that Proverbs 17:22a was his inspiration when he was going through some difficult times abroad: "A joyful heart is good medicine."		He told me that you are as young as you choose to be, and if you never let go of childlike wonder, you will never really be "old." He was the uncle who would come visit and would love to hear about anything we loved. Our happiness was his happiness, all the way up to the end. The doctors thought it amazing that he lived a few years beyond the date he was supposed to die of cancer, but I think his joyful spirit and regular fitness routine kept him going. 			**TL;DR** Be the uncle that your nieces and nephews smile when thinking about, even after you're gone. You don't need to be perfect, you just need to be loving.

Birthday suit up!		Always confuses my husband when I use that as the sexytime callI did this once and my husband and I laughed to much to do anything :D
Birthday suit up!		Always confuses my husband when I use that as the sexytime callI'm stealing this. This is mine now.  Thank you. 
You motherfuckerIt was a piece of cake for him to do that.
I think you mean Jonah Hill from anything where he wears a suit I think you mean the kid from Christmas Story after hitting puberty
Noisy toys with buttons are fun, but it's also great getting things like kazoos that make noise even when the parents say that the batteries have "gone missing".Haha yep. I got them some pennywhistles when I went to Ireland. The best part is the two whistles are in different keys. So even if they miraculously learned how to play them, and play them well, it still sounds awful.
Noisy toys with buttons are fun, but it's also great getting things like kazoos that make noise even when the parents say that the batteries have "gone missing".I once had a frenemy that would invited me to her children's birthday parties. I gifted a Fisher Price corn popper push toy. The one year old loved it and the mom hated it.  Mission accomplished. Every year I gave that kid the noisiest gift I could find. After I found and gifted the toy drum set, I wasn't invited back for the next birthday. 
I have a belly so I told my nephew I'm pregnant.  He thinks I'm an anomaly, since I'm a man, but he's convinced.  He gets freaked out when I let him feel the baby kick.  This has been going on for at least two years now.  He thinks it's a slow bake baby.  Found out he's been telling his friends at school about my miracle.  My ex s-i-l hates me for it (and because I make him call me Uncle Awesome).  That makes me commit even more.  How do you make the baby kick? My first strategy would be farts.
I want to be this kind of uncle but my nieces live about 1100 miles away :(I only ever saw my cool uncle every year or so, he is still my cool uncle even though I'm now 35.
You forgot the apathetic kind you hardly ever see but isn't a bad guy. He just doesn't care		Edit: not referring to people who are busy but make an effort when they see their nieces and nephews. In my own personal experience, I've had uncles who will only talk to me if i start the conversation and even then, only talk about the weather or the route they drove to get there. They worked 9-5 factory jobs or were retired and their kids were grown. They just preferred to sit there and drink their beer than have anything to do with me.I have no experience with that kind. I think that's better than 1 and 2 of my examples though!

> The weird kind who might have gone to prison at some point. He'll sell you booze if you're underage.		What kind of family doesn't give each other alcohol for free??Baptists
You also forgot the creepy uncle I also have a creepy uncle. He's handsy, but not quite over the top handsy. Kisses me on the neck when he sees me, says I'm looking good. that kind of creepy.
I find that the cool uncle and the racist uncle can sometimes overlap. Yeah, he's a cool dude, but damned if he isn't also quietly racist about everything. For me, it's cool and weird although he hasn't been to prison. He's just irresponsible with money and only works the most unstable job he possibly can. 		Cool guy though. Love him to death. 
Mine is some how all 3. Love him to death. He'll go to hell and back for me. Is your uncle Sirius Black?
I gave my niece a horse mask a few years ago, and they still use it all the time. 		I'll never forget the look of annoyance on their mothers face when she asked me "did you buy my daughter a horse mask?" When I first read "horse mask" I thought of a bridle and was wondering how they could use that... and then I remembered the horse mask meme.
Are they puppies?Humans, too, enjoy outdoor activities.
You know you got it bad if you're uncle is so addicted to math, all he'll ever do with you is teaching algebra.Does it count if that is my brother?		We are both in college right now(he is a PhD student, I'm still getting my bachelors), every time I see him, he tries to teach me whatever he is researching at the time, and that generally involves teaching me quite a bit of abstract algebra and high level calculus...		Still love him anyways :)

I got my nieces a drum kit when they were younger a year or so ago. It worked great until they took a poop in the drum. 		But it was still a win.

Jokes aside, I do the same to my little brother, atlhough not on the same academic level (I'm finishing my engineering bachelor, he's in high-school), to test wether I actually understand it myself. Either I'll be able to explain it to him, or I'll hit a struggle somewhere long the way and know what I need to study again.		So I'd just like to thank you (and all the little brothers out there) for your sacrifice, it helps a lot !		
Teaching a toddler to swear backwards is possibly the greatest joy in being an older sibling/relative.Is this a thing?
This is a needlessly distinguished mod comment written for comical purposes.This is a comment replying to a mod comment in hopes of fame and karma.
He was bread for opportunity.At yeast he put the effort in.
How'd he do it?I don't know, maybe by always treating me a slightly older than I was when I was a kid? When I was a teenager he talked to me about music a lot, both my age music and cool older music. And we've always talked about books. When I was in my late teens he'd joke about underage drinking. When I was over 18 he'd talk to me about going out to bars. Whenever he comes to my city he always rings and makes plans to catch up, and asks advice on what to do and where to take his kids. Now I have a kid he rings and asks how she is.	Really, he just treats me like a friend rather than someone younger than him, I guess. And he makes an effort to stay in touch. 
Actually I'm your Uncle, we just never got around to hanging out.hey its me ur uncle
Several of my uncles are this kind. Not really creepy, not bad guys, just not involved at all and very apatheticIt could also be because they're not on good terms with your parents. That's my experience at least.

Paying rent/r/spiderbro
Paying rentThis totally made my day. Look at that cute perfect little smile it's amazing. 
Paying rentMaybe he's trying to pay you for all the snacks found under the cushions... 
Paying rentAw little guy, you don't need to pay more. You pay your rent by being cute and eating little gnats!!		Whenever we find those little wolf spiders in our house they get to stay. Our son named our most recent one "Shoe."
Paying rentPersonally, I'm quite fond of all my spider tenants and think that the "flying insect removal service" alone is quite sufficient for rent, no need to pay anything more. I'm even willing to respect the integrity of the webs if they are in a place where they aren't getting in my way.

Paying rentWhat a nice meme, thank you! This is such a wonderful sub, it even makes you feel wholesome for the spiders, I'll make sure to thank the next black widow I see in my bathroom for being so responsible about her finances!
Paying renthaha that's a lovely thought
Paying rentI came here expecting to see lots of "kill it anyway" comments. Don't hate on our little spider bros and sis', they just eat yucky pesky bugs and keep your homes pest-free! They know they look a bit spoopy so they stay in the corner trying to keep out of sight.
Paying rentDoes that mean that when I pick up a spider by its legs and throw it out of the window, I'm actually evicting it for not paying up on time? 
Paying rentI don't like being surprised by spiders, but at the same time I don't bother to hunt them down either. Just, yknow... spiderbro. When I'm in the shower please don't be two inches from my face. (I can barely see without my glasses so it was really scary)
Paying rentI can imagine him beaming with pride as he rolls a nickel down the sidewalk
Paying rentBest bro spider: eats bugs and even pays rent!

I'm even willing to respect the integrity of the webs if they are in a place where they aren't getting in my way.I'm gonna give you a really considered pro-spider rationale.  Here goes.		* Spiders move relatively slowly, and can only come at you from the floor, walls, or ceiling.		* Spiders don't, though.  They mostly just leave you alone unless you rustle their jimmies somehow.		* Spiders eat a lot of flying insects.		* The flying insects sometimes sting or bite you, and they come at you from any direction, through the air.		CONCLUSION: Bruh...spiders.

I think that sounds like a really good pass time!Yeah I could see a comic series with this premise getting very popular, here particularly. 
A happy spider is a happy homeI had one I named "Bitsy" that lived for months behind my toilet tank.  I actually missed her when she left.
[Fist bump](https://i.redd.it/jx050mhobsjx.jpg)This something I know 100% in my mind I will never experience.  I run like Kramer in the episode where he gets free coffee for life when I see a spider.  My wife has to grab a napkin and scoop up the little fella and put him outside.

Like a little carroon character eating too much.

I had one I named "Bitsy" that lived for months behind my toilet tank.  I actually missed her when she left.Somewhat random story.  I have a garden every summer and one day I went out to the garden, picked up my trowell and felt a crunch under my finger.  To my dismay, I had just killed a spider who happened to be a mother guarding her egg sac.  I brought the sac inside, created a spider incubator which is simply pantyhose suspended over a water bath which provides humidity for the developing eggs. 	  	  	Within about 2 weeks the eggs "sprouted" their legs!  I got some flightless fruit flies and they started hunting/growing.  I ended up having about 30-40 of the little dudes.  I let about 5 of them go in different areas of my house since lots of bugs come in during the summer.  Half of the remaining spideys were let go near lights on the outside of my house, and the other half were released in my garden.  For the next two years one of my kiddos lived in my bathroom and would spy on people while they showered.  I miss them.

Why wouldn't you just kill them They're helpful. Would you rather have one spider, or five flies and 15 mosquitos and three cockroaches?

Trump has his fake tan as well, and Hillary definitely wore extensive make up during every public appearance. Especially at the debates she even had makeup on her neck to hide wrinkles haha.
Is it actually clear that it depends on your life decisions, as opposed to genetics or sheer luck?Nope, I don't think it's opposed to. I think it's alongside. I mean, I've never tried being 60, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are someone out there who are just going to age very fast regardless of their choices in life, but it sure as hell won't help if they smoke on top of that. I'm just saying that's when your decisions in life are *really* going to show, I believe. Your genetics show through much earlier. You know, like a 30 year old with a babyface, or a 15 year old who could pass for 22. These differences are always there.
Is it actually clear that it depends on your life decisions, as opposed to genetics or sheer luck?People who drink all their lives compared to those who eat healthy and exercise show clear physical differences at that age.

Almost. If you convert that number to seconds it comes very close to the number 1.64e+9 which is 52 years in seconds. 	So the guy is around 52 years old. 	This makes complete sense.

I imagine both of them have at least had some minor plastic surgery done. Trump has his fake tan as well, and Hillary definitely wore extensive make up during every public appearance.

New HatKid's home made gifts are the best.   My favorite band is TMBG.  When my daughter was about 10, for fathers day she gave me piece of string and a "rock to wind the string around".   I'd go back into the burning house for that rock and string.		I also have two different pencil holders my sons made when they were in kindergarten.   OJ cans covered in red felt with a picture glued to it.  Both on my desk at work 25 years later!
New HatI wish I had a dad. 
New HatThis is beautiful. Thank you for making me smile :)
New HatHe became a pirate.
New HatMy son made me a tie for Father's Day because he saw a commercial that said dads wear ties. However, I don't wear a tie to work and he didn't have money so he made one and told me if I ever need one at work, I can use his. It is hung on my desk for Everyone to see. 
New HatHa reminds me of my dad with every stupid art project I gave him. Even as an adult he still loves my hand made Christmas gifts. God I love that man, I think I'll go tell him. :)
New HatSeen this before.. knew then ending... still couldn't stop a big smile. :D Thank you for my smile!
New HatMy Dad would have been 61 today. Though I've been thinking about him all day, nary a tear has been shed... until this damn cartoon came along and left me with all the feels.

New HatI'm so happy my comics keep making other people happy	So before I'm gone I'll be sure I'll be happy to leave this world knowing a small fraction of this planet smiled because of something I did, have an awesome life everyone!  
New HatMy Dad is dying of brain cancer right now, we don't expect him to live through the weekend. This hit me in the feels but in such a good way. My father was absolutely this man, is still this man and I will cherish that forever.
New HatWhen you are a loving father you wear everything your children give you with gleaming pride! Every goofy tie and hand made pin is just one more excuse to show off to the world how awesome your children are!
New HatWhat do you make of this? I dunno, a hat, a plane... 
New HatHey, today is my birthday too!		I hope everyone has a great day today!
New HatMy then gf now wife did something kind of like this for my father.  		We lived in a different town and it was honestly my first time being that far from my family.  Well, fathers day was coming up so my gf and I wore hockey jerseys representing his favorite teams and held up a note that said Wish We Were There.		This was almost 10 years ago and that picture is still hung up on the side of my mom and dads fridge.
New HatHe better be careful, those un-wholesome people must want to steal his hat.

Ronaldo seems like a good dude.I have a friend who works in advertising and had a client hire him for a commercial.  He's apparently VERY difficult to work with -- he's very particular about how he spends his time and what he is/isn't willing to do for numerous reasons.		My friend said that it was the most tense and uncomfortable shoot she ever worked because of the relationship between the client and the talent (Ronaldo).  However, the moment the shoot ended it was like he made a 180 degree turn and was instantly inviting people to dinner and telling stories.		Basically, he seems to be the ultimate of work hard/play hard.  When he's in business mode, he's Ronaldo-- things go his way, or they go the wrong way -- however he's incredibly warm and generous when he's being "Cristiano" casually.

I like people that support you and don't criticize you when you speak another language. Learning a new language is hard and even after a lot of training you might still have an accent.

You should probably ask how their Hindi is. Urdu is the language of Pakistan, which, similar as it is to Hindi, is considered a different language. Urdu is one of the official language of india too. It's just that less people speak it and it's not the lingua franca in India.
Thanks for mentioning that. English is my third language. Couple months ago when I was working at AT&T call center one lady called and said that I have an accent, so she refused to speak to me. She asked me to bring someone white with perfect English on the phone. I quit that job two weeks after that. Now I'm studying computer science and currently enrolled at English 102 Composition class which I'm loving!I can barely speak my mother tongue, I only have respect for those that can speak more than one language. Even if it's rudimentary. 
I used to have a stutter. One time my favorite author came to a local book shop near my house. It was packed. I loved her books but didn't have much money so I looked kinda like a living shack.

Currently he's the best there is (I'm not knocking Messi, but currently the award is for Ronaldo)The guy had a better year (trophy-wise) but Messi is still the better player. 
For me, while it's not as bad as him laughing at me as well, I think it wouldn't be enough for it not to be a horrific bad memory that would haunt me for the rest of my days. I'm talking 'sleep with tv on' tier haunting. Why so sensitive? If you're new to a language obviously you won't be an expert at it. If it were me I'd probably laugh along with them. There's nothing wrong with being new to something. It sounds funny to experienced speakers so they laugh. Even Ronaldo was smiling and close to laughing with them. 		Ronaldo had a great point but I feel like it's better to encourage people that it's okay to be bad at something. Pitying people just seems really patronizing to me honestly, but I get what he was trying to say and it's a good sentiment.

I'm not a Man Utd fan, but they're both legends in a modern era. 	First opportunity was by Boloni in Sporting CP by calling him to a senior squad when he was only 17 years old. That's when it started. Man Utd is "simply" the second phase after Ronaldo wrecks Man Utd defense in the friendly Sporting vs Man Utd.		After that game, the rest is history but there's a story before Ferguson. Undoubtedly he was very important to him though, of course.

There is another player called Lionel Messi who is also considered one of the greatest players of all time, and he plays for a rival team called Barcelona. 		Its amazing because they are probably the two best players ever and play in the same period of time, so naturally there is a lot of debate over which player is better - which gets heated at times.		And Ronaldo has a famous cocky persona on the field which makes him more controversial but he does seem a really cool guy genuinely and he does loads for charity.

In 2015 this boy was signed to Sporting CP's Under 19 team, one of the biggest football clubs in the world. Also the club where Ronaldo's career began.

Ronaldo has to be one of the most wholesome superstars in the world. My favorite story about his charity is about the 2004 Earthquake that devastated Indonesia:		>Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a No. 7 Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed.		>Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction. [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo#Philanthropy)		Through fundraising, auctioning of sports paraphernalia, and partnership with a beverage company, Ronaldo was able to help provide about $100,000 US to the city of Aceh to be used for repairs and reconstruction. 		He's quite a remarkable guy!Ronaldo also donated 5 million dollars immediately after the earthquake in Nepal.
Cena's #2. Don't know how, you wouldn't be able to see him drop off the check.Cena seems like a great guy. He has a kind face, too.
Well if Peyton Manning isn't on a charitable athletes list then I question its method of selection. He has a children's hospital named after him and according to a hospital official his donations were in the neighborhood of $50 million. And he does more than just donate money, even after he moved to Denver he still made calls to the kids in the hospital.		http://www.wthr.com/article/childrens-hospital-to-be-named-after-peyton-manning		http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/columnists/gregg-doyel/2015/01/09/doyel-peyton-manning-isnt-what-you-think-hes-better/21511317/Technically he's not an athlete anymore.  I'm sure he's the number one philanthropist among Papa John's enthusiasts.
Also he's so handsome I want to punch him for it.Seriously dude, it's not fair. Be really handsome, or really good at soccer, not both. Leave some ladies for the rest of us. 
Interestingly, it's common for people who are far along in learning a foreign language to have better grammar and spelling than people who know the language as an L1 or L2 language. This is because people who learn a foreign language almost always learn the prestige, proper form while people who learn a language as an L1 or L2 will pick up a lot of regional slang and dialect variations in both diction and syntax that aren't considered "proper" in the prestige dialect.That's incredibly interesting. On a similar note, people who are concerned about their grammar are more aware of it and I would think they'd use it more correctly. It's like skinny people who are always calling themselves fat, even though they're skinny. The fact that they're aware makes them skinny. 
Hi			(sorry for my bad English) Sorry but without a period it's basically unreadable.
~~In all honesty I think its super tacky when people do that. If I can't tell that English is your second language because you write in it better than the majority of people on this site, it just comes off as a huge humblebrag to me. At least tell me where you're from so I can read it in the right accent.~~		EDIT: I've already had a lot of good responses to this comment and I have reconsidered my opinion; I feel bad for automatically assuming the worst about people. I consider being bilingual to be a huge accomplishment/advantage, so I apologize if it sounded like I'm trying to take anything away from those who are.I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they don't know that their writing is impeccable.

So much that they feel like they must defend themselves. Therefore no matter how well they speak it, they feel if they make one minuscule error, they will be ridiculed.

Also, if we do make mistakes with our writing, people are generally going to be less judgemental and kinder when pointing out our mistakes. 		I'm Indonesian (Sundanese) by the way, just in case you want to read my comment with an accent

Yeah. I think it's possible that people whose native language isn't English sometimes write "your" instead of "you're", even though they definitely know the difference, but I if someone writes "would of", it's almost 100% sure they're a native speaker.Honestly, I think that happens more frequently in native speakers because they are the ones who rely more on the sound of the word they're writing.		It baffles me how people can't distinguish "your" from "you're", but then again, I see those same type of errors in other natives speaking my language (portuguese).

Sure, but considering the situation, Hindi makes more sense. That's all I'm saying. Maybe he knows his colleagues and knows what language they speak? 
Oh god. This is /r/wholesomememes, if this thread turns into a Messi vs Ronaldo thread we may have to be quarantined. No need for any versus here! Both amazing players and people and everyone has their own favorite :D
Oh god. This is /r/wholesomememes, if this thread turns into a Messi vs Ronaldo thread we may have to be quarantined. People don't appreciate enough just how rare it is to have two of the greatest players to have ever lived playing in rival teams in the same time period. These two will go down as legends, both of them. 			But considering off the pitch, I reckon Ronaldo > Messi. Ronaldo gives loads to charity, Messi dodges taxes 
Oh god. This is /r/wholesomememes, if this thread turns into a Messi vs Ronaldo thread we may have to be quarantined. As a hockey fan who doesn't follow soccer, I'm getting some serious deja vu over here of 'Ovi vs Crosby'
They're both amazing players and people :D  Eh Messi isn't so great off the field. Avoiding millions in taxes, for one. 
Cocky is fine if you can back it up. Also be a good human being.He's not just cocky though, he's a bit of a dickhead on the pitch. Off it, the man is brilliant. On it, not so much.
I showed this pic set to my bf (he's a football nut) and just told me a metric ton of good things this dude has done. Stuff he does for his family, his mom, his best friend, lots of young fans, and holy crap he is one generous guy. My bf said basically the same thing, that he is pretty disliked due to his cockiness. He really does seem like a really awesome guy! He used to be a lot worse when he was younger but of course he has matured since then
Which I've always found weird, I don't really see said cockiness. He is arguably the best player in the world at the moment, of course you would exude confidence in your behavior if you were. But that's not the same as being a douche, which he doesn't seem to demonstrate. If you actually see interviews like this one you can see that he seems like a pretty chill dude, I don't see any arrogance in his manner of speaking. People who say he's an arrogant douche don't really know him and just resent him being called the best player when they disagree. For me the reason isn't the cockiness, the man is a fucking soccer god it's all right to be cocky. I dislike him as a player for constantly flopping and begging the ref for calls. Its unseemly for one of the greats to resort to shit like that. That being said he is still amazing, and seems like an incredibly nice guy off the pitch,
c:Have a great night OP
What was the kid saying? That his biggest dream is to be a soccer player....didn't understand what he said in between but I think he said that he wants to play with him some day...then asked what he should do to achieve that goal. I'm not a Portuguese speaker but I speak fluent Spanish and they're very similar. 
This man is having a stroke.(   )
That boy plays for a big club in Portugal now!Not just a big club - it's Sporting CP!		There was an Indonesian book that collected the stories of child survivors of the tsunami - Martunis was one of them.		It's a very pleasant surprise to hear this.
That boy plays for a big club in Portugal now!That's amazing
That boy plays for a big club in Portugal now!Well he has yet to play for the under 19 squad so I doubt he will make the jump to the B team and then to the A team but it is a good gesture from the club. 
I am Indonesian and always forgot he did this! I was still 4 years old back in 2004 though so I didn't pay much attention back then.>4 years old back in 2004		My God I'm getting old

Edit: story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/03/cristiano-ronaldo-operation-83000Yes I heard this - they asked for his boots to auction off for charity, so he paid for the operation and got that zig zag shaved in the side of his head to imitate the scar that the kid had after the treatment :)
Ronaldo also donated 5 million dollars immediately after the earthquake in Nepal.I don't think that's true. You might want to verify that. :)

That is probably 80% of my error with it. The other 20% is when I really don't care which one I'm using. 
My Indian friends talk in English between each other for that very reason... Its super curiousEnglish is quite common too. If they're from different parts of India, they may be more comfortable with English than what ever regional languages.
No need for any versus here! Both amazing players and people and everyone has their own favorite :DExactly. Why do people have to argue about who's the best? Can we not just acknowledge them as incredible players of their own right? It's not like it's an individual game anyhow.
As a hockey fan who doesn't follow soccer, I'm getting some serious deja vu over here of 'Ovi vs Crosby''bird vs magic' for me, or more modern, 'lbj vs joel embiid'
Eh Messi isn't so great off the field. Avoiding millions in taxes, for one. Ronaldo is currently being investigated for tax dodging as well, so I'll reserve my judgement of that when the investigation is over.
He's not just cocky though, he's a bit of a dickhead on the pitch. Off it, the man is brilliant. On it, not so much.I can understand that. But if I were personally being paid loads of money each year to play a game I love, while having sex with the hottest people in my country every night, I could see it getting to my head.

Well he has yet to play for the under 19 squad so I doubt he will make the jump to the B team and then to the A team but it is a good gesture from the club. Well he at the very least is working part-time as an on-the-books player for a big club. Worst case scenario he might end up with a relatively decent career in lower leagues, it's still a really special outcome, just not the fairytale we so desire.

That guy must have felt like shit doubtful. it'd be nice, but people who'd post antagonistic things like this generally don't have capacity for self-awareness, at least not enough to feel shame, anyways.
That guy must have felt like shit Nah, he's probably livid they didn't respond in a way that he could escalate his bigotry. 
That guy must have felt like shit Hopefully he had a life-changing realisation about the futility of hate and decided to donate more stuff.
That guy must have felt like shit I doubt it. He probably just rolled his eyes. Heck, there's virtually no way he'd intended to send them anything except a snotty message, so his work was done as soon as he hit send. 		There's an interesting and subtle potential dig in there that I like--the mosque will use the bacon to feed the hungry, which needs doing...because maybe other people (e.g., Christians) aren't doing it? I'm pretty sure there's nothing in the Bible about sending people bacon as a passive-aggressive insult to their religious beliefs, but there totally *is* something in there about feeding the hungry. 
That guy must have felt like shit He got his 10 likes, he was probably just disappointed his comment didn't earn him more fake Internet points.

That guy must have felt like shit Not much of a difference to what he really is. 
That guy must have felt like shit I'm not so sure it was a hateful donation. Giving a bible  to non believers is seen as a very thoughtful and loving act among Christians. In this guys mind, he is providing some food for people as well as an opportunity at everlasting life. That's what he believes he is donating. 		Edit: /u/sonrise pointed out to me Muslims can't eat bacon.... i guess that's what I get for thinking the best of someone.

What people don't understand is that there's primitive people in every religion. Every religion at one point or another has resulted in death or in bringing hope to people.And the vast majority of those people live in impoverished countries that would be afflicted by systematic violence anyways. Religion is just one vehicle for hate and frustration in inhospitable and/or oppressive nations. Mexico is war-torn by armed insurgent violence but nobody suggests Catholicism is inherently violent because they recognize that the root cause is the drug trade; in the Middle East, the issues are somewhat more obscure, but drought, famine, and totalitarianism are still clearly hurting people, irrespective of religious zealotry. The United States is far from perfect but comparatively it's extremely wealthy and peaceful, so there's no reason to believe the 3 million Muslim Americans are any different from any other religious group. The few radicalized Muslim terrorists that have been Americans cited foreign terrorist groups as inspiration, and these groups recruit by pointing to anti-Islamic rhetoric in the United States. As in every other country on Earth, violence will follow poverty and oppression, so anti-Islamic sentiment leading to the suggestion or implementation of oppressive policies will incite far more Islamic terrorism by mentally ill and isolated people looking for an outlet than it will ever prevent.
What people don't understand is that there's primitive people in every religion. Every religion at one point or another has resulted in death or in bringing hope to people.I belive people can be good without religion. I also belive they can be good with religion.		I don't belive that religion makes you good though. If it's not already in your heart, the religion won't change you for the better.
I can't speak for anywhere else but Muslims in North America are some of the chillest, nicest people around. Being a minority they have to wade through so much shit but they just keep on keepin on.Can you say this isn't true for every religion? Most people, most places are pretty chilled out and nice.

"I've got my eye on you, Omnic."		"And I will watch yours in turn."I love that interaction!		(for thems not in the know - It's from Overwatch. Specifically, it is an interaction between a robot [omnic] chararacter named Zenyatta [kind of an android cyber monk] and Zarya [a russian bodybuilder tank-type character]. The game is set several years after a war between Omnics and Humans, so there is a lot of tension between the Omnic and Human characters in the game.

Yeah, the response doesn't seem snarky, seems like they're just trying to extend an olive branch. This is actually a common thing now.

Well Muslims consider Christians to also be people of the book.I think their response would be the same irrespective of the scripture proposed
doubtful. it'd be nice, but people who'd post antagonistic things like this generally don't have capacity for self-awareness, at least not enough to feel shame, anyways.He probably just feels now that Muslims love handouts and are trying to take his hard earned bacon sandwiches and bibles from him.

Maybe he's not even that islamphobic, maybe he was just being edgy for the sake of it. It's entirely possible he felt a little chargined by the lack of aggressive response, and learned a valuable lesson that day. 
Hopefully he had a life-changing realisation about the futility of hate and decided to donate more stuff.Aww 
He got his 10 likes, he was probably just disappointed his comment didn't earn him more fake Internet points.Luckily that wasn't reddit . cause he might recieve a lot of unlikes .
I'm not so sure it was a hateful donation. Giving a bible  to non believers is seen as a very thoughtful and loving act among Christians. In this guys mind, he is providing some food for people as well as an opportunity at everlasting life. That's what he believes he is donating. 		Edit: /u/sonrise pointed out to me Muslims can't eat bacon.... i guess that's what I get for thinking the best of someone.  I thought so too except that he mentioned specifically bacon sandwiches, which Muslims cannot eat.

And the vast majority of those people live in impoverished countries that would be afflicted by systematic violence anyways. Religion is just one vehicle for hate and frustration in inhospitable and/or oppressive nations. Mexico is war-torn by armed insurgent violence but nobody suggests Catholicism is inherently violent because they recognize that the root cause is the drug trade; in the Middle East, the issues are somewhat more obscure, but drought, famine, and totalitarianism are still clearly hurting people, irrespective of religious zealotry. The United States is far from perfect but comparatively it's extremely wealthy and peaceful, so there's no reason to believe the 3 million Muslim Americans are any different from any other religious group. The few radicalized Muslim terrorists that have been Americans cited foreign terrorist groups as inspiration, and these groups recruit by pointing to anti-Islamic rhetoric in the United States. As in every other country on Earth, violence will follow poverty and oppression, so anti-Islamic sentiment leading to the suggestion or implementation of oppressive policies will incite far more Islamic terrorism by mentally ill and isolated people looking for an outlet than it will ever prevent.Am I still on Reddit?

whosagoodboy.jpgEvery dog!
Mine sucks. She's a good pet. Doesn't chew, bark, pee inside...		But she's a terrible dog...she doesn't play with toys, want to wrestle, go swimming, play with anyone.... chew on toys... have fun.... she's afraid of sticks, doesn't want to learn tricks, doesn't fetch balls. She's afraid of balls actually. 		Does anyone want her?	She's a really good *pet*My dog was like that, did not act like a "normal dog". I think he grew up around kids and cats tbh. Then we adopted another dog. We've had the other dog almost a year now and the first dog acts way more dog-like. You just need another do to show your dog how to dog. 
This one time my family adopted a black lab. She was one of the dumbest animals I've ever met. I saved her from drowning in shallow water on two separate occasions. She didn't know how to go down stairs. She would just kinda run down them and would always fall, one time cutting her neck open. She would also try to start shit with my other dogs like stealing their food. My dogs would get the best of her but the next day she'd go for their food again. We ended up giving her to another family. She was not a good dog. Good dog in the wrong home.		My dog doesn't get along with other dogs but she's great in a single dog household.
Why are you so happy brant?He had a good day, which may or may not involve good doggo.
Why are you so happy brant?You had one job
Don't forget treats.That's the third dogmendment
Why do we put them in shitty conditions, then?		Sleeping outside in a wooden box, and probably some other things.My doggos sleep inside tho.

My doggo takes up more of the bed than i doI have one little doggo that likes to curl up in a ball right on top of me while I sleep and another that lays completely spread out on the foot of the bed. Can confirm, there is more space occupied by dog in my bed than human.

Seen on AskReddit's "What do you do to subtly fuck with people?"I do the opposite to my boyfriend. He has a thing for saying extremely lame puns. When he does I go silent and put on the angriest expression I can manage and tell him "I hate you so much". But the angrier I get, the more pleased with himself he gets. His doofy cute smile gets bigger and bigger and he ends up making himself crack up. But his laugh is so contagious it always breaks my facade of anger and we both end up falling on top of each other laughing. He's the most amazing person I've ever known.

Seen on AskReddit's "What do you do to subtly fuck with people?"Hey, cool this was my comment!  Here's a recent example if you're up for it:  a couple days ago she was up early cleaning the kitchen. I got up, she wanted to surprise me with it all being done already. "Aww I thought I heard something buzzing around."  She said, "Yep! I'm a bee!"  I laughed.  She said the bathrooms were done too " Because that's how the bee bumbles!"  I laughed super hard. She laughed. Rest of the day she "buzzed" and I'd lose it every time.

Seen on AskReddit's "What do you do to subtly fuck with people?"Sometimes me and my wife will just sit across from each other and fake laugh without stopping. Usually after less than 30 seconds or so it just transforms into real gut busting laughter at the situation and the rest of the night seems to be lighter and more relaxed since we started out on such a goofy note. Its fun.
Seen on AskReddit's "What do you do to subtly fuck with people?"My wife is really susceptible to ear worms from me, so when she's having a bad day, I'll hum her favorite uplifting songs and watch as she gets bubblier and starts singing along, too :)
Seen on AskReddit's "What do you do to subtly fuck with people?"My SO laughs at my laugh. I'm really silly when I'm not at work, so I'll say something I think is funny and laugh and stare at him for a reaction and he'll start laughing at the ridiculousness of me just staring at him..... The staring always intensifies.... Just thinking about it makes me laugh.

I  hate it when people tell me white lies or give me false praise just to try to make me feel good.		How would this guy's wife feel if she read this, knowing it was about her? She'd be crushed.

It ended up with my husband trying to put his balls on my forehead (while the kiddo wasn't looking) while I screamed and laughed so hard it hurt. Took us right back to when we were dating and it was really nice. Reminded me to get silly more often.

As someone who is very happily married, it makes me inordinately happy to see other people who are also happily married. Feels like genuine enjoyment of marriage is rare. I hear so many of my coworkers complaining constantly about their spouses : / I have no clue why. :/ Marriage is the best if you have somebody you genuinely love. It means you get to be with your best friend forever and even touch their butt. What could be better than that?!		People complaining about their spouses all the time should seriously take a look at their life and figure out if this is what they really want. Everybody deserves to be with somebody that makes them happy and who they make happy in return. 		We're just extra lucky because we already found that awesome person to marry. Yay us!
Man, I wish this happened to me. I tell myself I'm funny anyways, though. But you're funny. I just smiled reading your comment.
Am I the only person here that understands what was meant by that answer and is slightly appalled at it?		"How do you subtly fuck with..."		he is using Pavlovian conditioning to make his wife unfunny! She's going to be repeating these unfunny jokes to her friends and coworkers thinking they're hot shit guaranteed for a laugh, and end up getting crickets.		This guy is evil!		Seriously... I'm sure you're all right, but you must concede that this is a legitimately plausible possibility! 		I totally get where this outlook is coming from, especially when you look at the post title. I think it's a great point actually and we should always consider that there is the possibility that the popular view isn't the correct one! And it *always* depends on the relationship too. But, just to give you a look at the other side, I'm going to counter it:		His wife knows she's not funny. When your spouse is the only one who laughs at your jokes, you pick up pretty quickly that most people don't find you funny. You think one of two things; either your spouse is just laughing because they love you or they're laughing because they have a weird sense of humor too. If you're in a happy, healthy relationship you don't ever assume it's because they're trying to trick you into thinking that you're funny when you're not.		Example: My humor is carefully tailored to one exact audience: my family. I can't change it and nobody else thinks that I'm funny because I'm honestly not. But my parents and siblings think I'm fucking hilarious. Mostly because that is the weird humor we were all raised with so we are all messed up together. 		My husband does not share that sense of humor. Which is unfortunate for him because no way am I not cracking jokes. I do it not to entertain him but because I find those jokes funny. He is a sweetheart and laughs anyways because it makes me feel appreciated. He doesn't think I'm funny but he loves me and appreciates that I'm sharing those dumb jokes with him because I also love him. 		It's not a lie or manipulation, it's a form of support. The same way you never tell your spouse that they're looking bloated today. You keep that to yourself because there isn't anything they could do to change that, they probably already know anyways, and saying it just isn't helpful. 		**TL;DR You laugh at your spouse's dumb jokes because those jokes make them happy and they're sharing that happiness with you.** <3
Dude, what? You've been leading her on with fake laughs instead of being honest with her? How is that wholesome?I find it weird how much I had to scroll down to find your comment. This is not wholesome, this is being dishonest to your partner and I wouldn't be able to live with it.
Dude, what? You've been leading her on with fake laughs instead of being honest with her? How is that wholesome?Yeah, this seems really dishonest and not wholesome. How would she feel reading this post?
Dude, what? You've been leading her on with fake laughs instead of being honest with her? How is that wholesome?Imagine how happy he'll be when he finds out she was faking all her orgasms!
Dude, what? You've been leading her on with fake laughs instead of being honest with her? How is that wholesome?The laugh may be fake, but her smile is real
Dude, what? You've been leading her on with fake laughs instead of being honest with her? How is that wholesome?Because it's a little itty bitty amount of effort that brings immense joy to someone he loves. Had this been phrased "when my wife tells an OK joke, I'll laugh like it's the funniest thing I've ever heard because I love how happy it makes her", I doubt you'd be as concerned.		You ever had someone go out of their way to accommodate you or cheer you up when you're down? That's not always manipulation... sometimes it'a just going a bit out of your way to make someone feel good.		Don't read so much into things.
Dude, what? You've been leading her on with fake laughs instead of being honest with her? How is that wholesome?Yeah, all these comments encouraging this make me feel a little sick. Really manipulative and not wholesome at all :(.
Dude, what? You've been leading her on with fake laughs instead of being honest with her? How is that wholesome?If it is a more serious topic, lying instead of honestly critiquing what someone does might be nice in the moment, but will ultimately hurt them down the road. 		But this is just telling jokes to each other, I see no harm in over exaggerating one's laugh, especially when it is such a source of joy for the wife. At worst the wife tells a joke to someone else and they don't laugh, but you can just pass it off as them having no humor. 
I'm kind of confused. I find this kind of dishonesty a bit disturbing to be honest. I would hate being lied to and manipulated into believing something that was not true.I could not agree more! If I found out my boyfriend was doing this to me, I would be disgusted with him.
My husband is too busy trying to show me I'm not funny that his first reaction is to show disdain, not support. Not sure why he's such a fun sucker  but I hope one day he stops viewing other people who are better than him at certain things, as a threat. It will honestly get soul crushing after a while, good luck. My jokes become more self deprecating by the day. Ha ha
That's a pretty fucked up thing to do.My exact thought. If I knew someone was doing this to me I'd lose a shit ton of my confidence.
I don't care if everyone else in the world thinks I'm the most unfunny person in the world. As long as my girlfriend thinks I'm hilarious, I'm happy. When you have someone at home that thinks the world of you, the rest of the world doesn't matter. You can handle anything.
That's cute :)You're cute :)
That's cute :)That makes me feel really good!
Hi Pal!		How does one acquire a girlfriend?		EDIT: Never got so many genuine helpfull comments on reddit, keep up being awsome!Best, honest advice? Don't TRY to find a girlfriend. Just keep doing the things you do, be proud of who you are, and a girl will find a perfect boyfriend in you :)
Hi Pal!		How does one acquire a girlfriend?		EDIT: Never got so many genuine helpfull comments on reddit, keep up being awsome!Well, for one you gotta be wholesome, and apart from that just be yourself. And then you'll eventually find the right one.
Hi Pal!		How does one acquire a girlfriend?		EDIT: Never got so many genuine helpfull comments on reddit, keep up being awsome!What worked for me: trying being the person YOU would want to be with.  Be kind, honest, trustworthy, responsible.  Take joy in the things that actually interest you.  Be genuine.		And don't rush shit.  [This is the hardest thing once you find someone you like.]  Human relationships are built on experiences over time.  Some of my best life-long friends have very little in common with me personality/interest-wise, but we had a lot of mutual experiences that tie us together.

Hi Pal!		How does one acquire a girlfriend?		EDIT: Never got so many genuine helpfull comments on reddit, keep up being awsome!I think being genuine friends with a few girls helps too, even if it's friend's girlfriends or something. If they are genuinely you're friend then often they can help steer other girls your direction if they think you're a decent guy.
Hi Pal!		How does one acquire a girlfriend?		EDIT: Never got so many genuine helpfull comments on reddit, keep up being awsome!Spend a lot of time with a girl you know that you aren't related to and after a while either starting dating / having sex with her or meet her friends and repeat the process. The caveat is these need to be people you genuinely enjoy spending time with. This can be tough for men whose interests rarely overlap with women's, which is why you either need to be patient, or consider exploring exciting, new interests that women tend to share!		Best of luck, and know that while girlfriends and sex and friends are very enriching parts of life, not having those at any given time does not make your life any less rich or full of potential for exciting adventures.		Also remember, girls and girlfriends are no different than guy friends -- they only seem different because of the social implications of sex. So first and foremost, be a friend

Hi Pal!		How does one acquire a girlfriend?		EDIT: Never got so many genuine helpfull comments on reddit, keep up being awsome!I hit on every girl I was attracted to. Not cheesy one liners or anything. I just would strike up a conversation and see where it went. I am not that attractive and I used to get lots of girls to go on dates. You just need to go after it. I remember camping and meeting these random girls. At one point I decided I would just put my hand on this hot girls thigh and see how she reacted. She looked at me and said "pretty forward aren't you?" (or something) and I replied something about her being pretty. We were in my tent a little later on. 		PS I am short and sort of chubby. Just go for it.		PPS I can't describe how to do this without being creepy. Be approachable and light hearted. Don't be all intense. Use humour. My wife comments on my uncanny ability to get people to let their guard down and open up to me. 		PPPS. Also...talk about how you like family, kids, pets, etc. I worked with kids with disabilities and girls ate that shit up.

Definitely return the favor! My boyfriend doesn't show a whole lot of emotion, and my jokes always get a lot of laughs with my coworkers (who are all mainly girls). On the rare occasion I can get genuine laughter from my boyfriend (and not just a polite chuckle, or an "I get it" snicker), it makes me feel SO happy and funny. :)Hmm, my girlfriend is always making jokes that I don't find funny.   That's mostly because I watch a lot of stand up so it takes something outrageous to get a good laugh out of me. She also rarely laughs at my jokes, that I know are funny. Maybe I should try enjoying and laughing at her jokes harder.
My dad makes my mom laugh all the goddamn time. If she's in a bad mood or upset, idk how he knows exactly what to do, but he knows how to make her smile whenever. He always smiles when he makes her smile. It's just very sweet to watch.My dad is the same way! It's hard to get a genuine guffaw out of him but damn can he make my mom laugh. She's still madly in love with him because of it. She even has a signature way of saying his name when he's made a real good joke that all our family friends (and even some of my buddies) try to duplicate.		She says it when he's "in trouble," usually for telling a really terrible joke (he's the God of dad jokes) or when he's made some mildly scandalous remark in her presence. She's easily shocked by little things so it's easy to scandalize her. It's fun. I'm my father's daughter, so she yells at both of us all the time. It's wonderful. I miss them. 
The funniest thing my husband ever did was when he was mid shaving off facial hair; he left a moustache like Chris Hadfield, and decided to do an impression of his cover of space oddity... facial expressions and all. I nearly wet myself laughing - he had never done anything like that before which made it all the funnier!  Even after all this time, whenever I fall out with him I think of that and it cheers me right up again :DI grew my first "real" beard last year but I decided to shave it off at the beginning of this year. We were getting ready to take a shower together and my wife kept asking "what's taking so long?!"		I popped into the bathroom looking [like this](http://imgur.com/mXVuXF0) sporting a terrible Southern accent. She guffawed.		It's probably funnier knowing the context; I'm a Brit living in America married to a woman who grew up in a "country"-esque environment. And I hate country music.		As an aside, just last night my wife remarked on something while we were watching TV and it made me laugh so hard. We've been around each other for almost 10 years, and I love that she can still make me genuinely giddy with her humour and sass. I sometimes worry that she'll get tired of my humour (as my mum has of my dad's) but so far we still crack each other up.
This is called a "No soap, radio!" joke. 		The more you know. >  "No soap, radio!" joke		From [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_soap_radio): 		> "No soap radio" is a form of practical joke and an example of surreal comedy. The joke is in reality a prank whereby the punch line has no relation to the body of the joke  that is, it is actually not funny  but participants in the prank pretend otherwise. 		> The effect is to either trick someone unfamiliar with the prank into laughing along as if he or she "gets it" and/or ridicule him or her for not understanding.		Basically for the victim it's a no-win situation. If they laugh, they then get teased for laughing at a joke that wasn't funny. If they don't laugh, they get teased for not getting the joke!
This is called a "No soap, radio!" joke. 		The more you know. > This is called a "No soap, radio!" joke.		Didn't know this was a thing. We've been doing this in my family for years.

I own a Buick and a Pontiac. That sounds like what I'd say if I crashed my Buick.Such a wholesome reaction to crashing your car :)
You should watch the Vsauce episode called "Conformity". They do this exact psychological experiment on random people, it's hilarious.For those looking, this episode is only available to YouTube Red subscribers.  
Hey this is really funny. But don't assume they're laughing just because they try to fit in while not getting it. You are creating a hilarious situation and if everyone is laughing it might be really contagious! I would probably laugh my ass off at this, even if I wasn't in on it :)I've never seen anybody not exhibit pretty serious confusion, which make us laugh even harder. Sometimes they laugh, sometimes they ask for an explanation.		What's nearly equally amusing is explaining what just happened. They are sometimes so disoriented that they ask questions about the punchline.
I've made my boyfriend laugh so hard once that he puked. It's weird to say this because vomit was involved, but it was amazing and it made my life.It's not weird, it's like eating some pizza that's so good you can't stop eating, you might puke afterwards but the memories of that delicious pizza just can't be erased from your brain anymore. 
Guess who loves you back! Is it us?!
DankeBin zwar nicht OP, aber gern geschehen
r/absolutelynotmeirl		edit: hey wholesome fellas and gals, I didn't mean to be negative with my comment. it was just a joke :) stay lovely my friendsYou can be that adorable, man!
I find it weird that so many people find this wholesome and cute.		I wouldn't want anyone to tell me I'm funny if they think I'm not. I appreciate honesty, and a comforting lie is still a lie.What's being honest really worth in a situation like this, though? What does it entail? Making sure to never have more than a sensible chuckle at a moderately humorous joke? Telling someone that their joke wasn't particularly funny? 		I mean, life truly is what you make it. The guy in the post had an opportunity to have a genuine, gut-busting laugh with his wife, brighten her day and his, or to tell her that she isn't very funny and endure the ensuing crestfallen awkwardness. Where's the wholesomeness in that?
Same here, I'd find it really inauthentic.It would make me feel like I'm not actually funny and everything is just a pity laugh.
I agree, but the intention is what matters No, no it doesn't.  I had a friend who would fake laugh at everything and I hated him when I found out.   I felt manipulated and it distanced us. 
I could not agree more! If I found out my boyfriend was doing this to me, I would be disgusted with him.And then brag about it in a sense too. 
When you have someone at home that thinks the world of you, the rest of the world doesn't matter. You can handle anything.this is why I love my wife. Whenever I doubt my looks or my personality or my deeds, she reminds me that the only person who *really* matters thinks I'm hot and fun and a good person. And that makes me not doubt anymore.
When you have someone at home that thinks the world of you, the rest of the world doesn't matter. You can handle anything.Aw this made me feel better. I have a bully in my class I'm currently dealing with in nursing school. I'm 24 years old and dealing with a bully :(

And if i try to go out of my way to meet someone i'm not really being myself.		I study in an engineering university. Taking software engineering. So there's already little to none attractive girls. Then I live 40km away from my uni in the suburbs, alone, where i live far from any friends/family.		Since i have to travel from uni to home and i usually leave uni late, i can't really meet anyone interesting.		I might try to join a boxing gym near my house to see if i can get out more.

Live like you are married to the greatest woman alive. Don't be an asshole, but also don't shy away from other women. They are living things at all. As soon as you start acting, feeling and living like you are a content person who isn't after THAT girl or a quick fuck asap things will work out.		But please don't wear an actual fake wedding ring, though, only Adam Sandler does that...
Well, for one you gotta be wholesome, and apart from that just be yourself. And then you'll eventually find the right one.nice username
I think being genuine friends with a few girls helps too, even if it's friend's girlfriends or something. If they are genuinely you're friend then often they can help steer other girls your direction if they think you're a decent guy.In my case this has worked like more of a repellent it seems. The girls I'm friends with happen to be quite attractive. And they're single too. So when we're hanging out at bars people just tend to assume we're together. Either that or people think I'm gay.		Not that I have a problem with gay people, but it's tough to date girls if they all think you are interested in dudes.

The weird thing is that once you understand it, they actually become funny because you know what's happening.

Aw this made me feel better. I have a bully in my class I'm currently dealing with in nursing school. I'm 24 years old and dealing with a bully :( Don't allow it. I had a bully at my old age of 43 and dealt with her for a year. Finally told her what kind of person she was and how she made me feel. She couldn't handle the truth but her biggest fear was others thinking bad of her. She begged me not to let anyone believe she was being a bully. It was too late for that, she'd already don't that damage on her own. I left after that though.		I know you are in school and can't just leave but don't let it drag. I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. It makes things so much more difficult. Maybe you can move classes? I don't understand what people get out of doing that to others. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing I had intentionally bullied someone that day.

If the other person doesn't find your sense of humor funny, then obviously you two are not meant for each other. 		If you two do have compatible senses of humor, then try doing some activities together and keep up the jokes.

Well then I should just continue like now :)I agree with that advice, but also there are a few easy things you can do to improve your chances. Make sure you're hygienic and look fairly decent (edit: I meant clothes and stuff, I realized that it sounded like I was saying you just had to be attractive), and don't be afraid to approach women. If you see someone you find attractive, give them a smile and a genuine compliment, and try to start conversation, even if it's something mundane. 		Don't go looking for dates, but do make an effort to interact with people you're interested in. Most of the time it'll just end with you both feeling a little bit happier as you go on with your day, but it only takes one time for you to click.

We've been together 15 years.  So far so good.That's awesome. Here's to 15 more!
But what if it's funny because it's absurd? ;)I laughed so hard I cried and kept laughing so hard I started coughing which is when people know I'm not faking it. The joke was "what's the difference between a duck?  It's feet!"		I just imagined this duck searching for footwear and not being able to find any and going mental in a footwear store and lost it completely. Whereas my family actually thought it was a no soap no radio joke.		I explained that a duck has two feet that are identical so there's no difference between them, they then got confused that I was the first person in days to actually think the joke had meaning.		I love the shit out of some absurdist comedy because my brain tries to make it work and then completes the joke.
Two Penguins are sitting in a bathtub, one says "Pass me the soap" and the other says "What do you think I am a radio?"Lmao

I'm actually hooking up with a girl right now who says I am! it's crazy how something small like that can make me feel so much better :)Username...
My boyfriend tells me how painfully unfunny I am every day because I rarely make good jokes, and I hate it. I would very much rather have him fake laugh at every one of my jokes just to see me smile than tell me every time I make a joke that I'm not funny. He sounds kinda like a poophead though

>If it doesn't? I still had a ton of fun doing what I love, instead of wasting time searching for something that should come on its own.

He just got out of a bad relationship, started talking to/making out with a coworker who had a boyfriend, got back in his bad relationship, and is now out of it again. Now he's going to prom with a girl he works with. He's only 19, but he's a sophomore in college. I told him he shouldn't go. Like, just take a break dude, you don't always have to be with someone!
Sometimes it takes a week. Sometimes it takes 40 years. But if you keep being a confident, cool, collected person, and you reasonably "put yourself out there" e.g meet new people every now and then, you'll eventually meet the right person. There are too many humans on the planet for you not to meet one of the many compatible people out there :D> put yourself out there		That's the part numerous comments miss. Just doing your thing & being awesome isn't enough. Your "thing" has to include numerous social aspects with members of a compatible sex. It's a numbers game!
Girls want someone who does their own thing. If you don't have something you truly love doing, go try and find it. Then start doing that. 		A girl might come around and she might not. Worst case scenario you're still doing something you love What if your own thing doesn't involve leaving the house?
>  but I always tell me self if I keep at it, it will eventually. 		For this argument's purposes, that also counts as "trying". Stop caring about it. Stop thinking about it.No no. Keep at it means the things I love doing. Skate/longboarding, snowboarding, BMX, video games, working on computers. Like all that stuff I'll keep at. 
Weird to downvote this, guys. It's sound advice :)Thanks! I just figured that I would provide more advice to help our shy friends. :)

You can do both. "The one" doesn't happen along because you're doing your thing and they think "that's awesome I totally want you."Exactly this. No need to make yourself miserable being someone your not to attract someone, but if your idea of being true to yourself doesn't include you routinely meeting new people, you're not going to magically find yourself dating someone. Don't tell yourself that just as an excuse not to put in the work.

You obviously need to expose yourself to meeting new people if you want to find someone, just not in a way that's desperate. Just be a chill, cool person, and do things, and you'll eventually randomly meet a compatible single person.		Not that online dating is bad, it clearly works for a lot of people :)

When I'm feeling sad at the end of the day, something coming over to love me for being me is just... Nice. 		But otherwise, you're only 23. It's not that old. I don't know if Sweden has meetup - but you could try that. People give it flack, but tinder too. I mean even just chatting and flirting with people on there can build up confidence.		Have you tried online dating? People are rude about it, but as I'm not a big drinker, and I like to have conversations with people more, I've found that talking to people online helps...		And go to the doctor. If you feel depressed, you should always go to the doctor. Going to the doctor isnt going to instantly cure you, but it will help give you the tools you need to make you not-depressed. And it'll help you to find the thing that is holding you back - and only you can really figure it out, not someone else. You think right now it's because you're lonely, but you don't sound lonely. Go and figure it out with the doctor.		P.s. there is nothing wrong with taking pills for depression if you need to as well. Taking citalopram is what helped me to make the changes my life needed for me to be not depressed - and I would have stayed in the spiral of depression had I not made those changes. Once I made the changes, I could stop taking citalopram.		Importantly - I went to the doctors while my depression was pretty new.	Do not let the depression sit... Please :)

Your life sounds pretty rad even without girls. As a girl, I agree ( *castles* )
How does one get into blacksmithing as a hobby? I've been interested in it for a while, but never known how to startIt's fairly easy if you have a yard! You don't need lots of expensive equipment, at least to start with, you might choose to later on to make your life easier. I'd strongly recommend finding a blacksmith near you who does classes if you can- it gives you a taster without having to invest anything into it, and you'll be impressed with what you can produce just after the first day!		Doing it at home is also great, but you have to build/buy equipment first, and you'll likely be disappointed with your first session or two. As a result, quite a few end up quitting and wasting that time/money they put into starting. But stick at it- you will get good! 		I'd recommend starting with a solid fuel (coal or charcoal) forge, because they're easier than gas. It can be as simple as a hole in the ground. You need to force air in to get it up to temp, the easiest way is a hairdryer taped up to some steel pipe which sits at the bottom of the fire. You need some steel- steel stock is very cheap- I'd recommend using normal stock as IDing scrap takes some eyeballing and can make your life unnecessarily difficult as a beginner. You need something to hit it on- an anvil, bit of railroad track or just a lump of mild steel will do the job- many people use a big old sledgehammer head! You need something to hit it with- a hammer. Something to hold it- your hand is fine if the piece is large (you'll be surprised how bad steel is at conducting heat). Tongs are best, but big pliers or vice grips will do a job. The great thing with blacksmithing is that you can make your own tools, get your basics down first, simple hammer and anvil stuff, then after a while you can be making your own tongs, chisels and punches which you can go on to use in your products. 		I can't stress enough, to start with, keep it simple. Learn your basic operations- tapering, rounding, drawing, upsetting and bending- you will use these in absolutely everything you do. I thought I was hot shit and thought I'd go straight to knifemaking... only dissappointment follows! Do lots of simple stuff, then start introducing new skills. It's just as important for learning your skills as it is for building confidence. 		Check out /r/blacksmith, they're a friendly bunch and will be happy to help. iforgeiron.com is also an amazing resource, but I wouldn't start posting until you've read up most of the resources. There's a fair number of grumpy old fellas there who have done this as a living and now have to put up with a dozen people saying "I dont' know anything about blacksmithing, but tell me how to make a sword!" every day! Check out the '55 Forge' on there- it's a simple forge made from an old oil drum. I made one and it served me well for a year before I moved on. The other simple style is a brake drum forge.		Good luck out there! 
I am shy/have a hard time to "go". bite bullet and go, it's hard. Get out as much as you can. Its tempting to just stay at home and be a hermit, but if you keep doing it, before you know it, youll be 30 without achieving anything socially.		Do whatever it takes. Try a new hobbies every week until something sticks. Look up meetup.com. Make a bucket list stuff and act on it IMMEDIATELY (bungie jump, take a flight class, yoga/whatever). Go to the library and read self development books (I recommend David burns' book intimate connections in your case - it helped me with shyness/getting close to other people)		AVOID THE HOME AT ALL COSTS
Highschool isn't that badMy school had an autistic boy who loved to sing and dance. He had a helper who helped keep him focused during classes and assemblies, but it was very difficult for him to sit still and silent that long. He just wanted to sing!		When we were sophomores the school started this policy where they would have daily morning assemblies we would have to sit through. They were all presentations about on how to succeed in school, be a good person, etc. One was about fire safety. They were the worst. But they were especially bad for this kid, who had to sit still and silent for a whole forty-five minutes first thing in the morning EVERY SINGLE DAY. It was awful. The guy started misbehaving in class, throwing tantrums pretty much every day. You could see the tension on his face. It was not a good time.		Anyway, I have no idea who thought of it but eventually it became the tradition that whenever the presentation wrapped up, in whatever time we had left before first classes, the autistic guy could come up on stage and perform for the school. It was easily the best part of those terrible assemblies, the kid had a blast and the audience fucking loved it. He really was a good singer, and you could just feel the joy he had getting to do his favorite thing and have people go nuts for it. The tradition stuck even after the school nixed those godawful morning assemblies, and iirc they even let him sing at our graduation. 
Highschool isn't that badIn my old middle school there's a very sweet autistic boy named Xavier and when I was in the 8th grade he was in the 6th. We always passed each other in the halls and he'd always say "big guy!!" and I'd give him a big high five and be like "what's up little man" or something. It was always so nice to have my day brightened up by just those two words, so since my high school is connected to the middle school I'll go down to his room at lunch every once and a while and just talk with him. He always shares these really great stories about his "adventures" with other kids and it just warms my heart that everyone else is so kind to him. Love ya Xavier. :)
Highschool isn't that badOkay now I want to talk about David. 		David went to my middle school and was a completely blind Korean boy that reminds me of Chirrut Imwe from Rogue One (whose character is also a blind Asian guy). Watching that movie has made me think about him a lot lately. Well David would always request sitting next to me in class. He was the friendliest dude ever. David's jedi power was thumb wrestling. He had an incredibly hightened sense for the muscles in the hand, and where they would move next. Dude was the pinball wizard of thumb wrestling. Even the teachers couldn't beat him. He would also hold out his hand and be able to tell who you were just by a handshake. 		I'll always remember this one time, my birthday, when David stopped my eighth grade language arts class to sing me happy birthday in Korean Opera. Best day ever. I don't remember his last name, or know where he is now, but that dude was as pure as they come, and I hope he's doing well. 
Highschool isn't that badIt only takes one "cool" kid to do something nice like this and everyone else will follow. 
Highschool isn't that badThere was an autistic kid on my varsity soccer team. Unofficially, he was our manager and was meant to just sort of hang out with the coaches and carry some of the equipment around during practice, but we always included him whenever we could and if we were winning by enough, we would get him out on the field for the last few minutes. 		One game, we were crushing the other team-- I'm talking like 10-0 by the first half-- and as we start our warm-ups for the second half, the other team's captains came over to our coach with a proposition. They wanted to let the autistic kid score a goal at the beginning of the half. We're a bit caught off guard but we obviously accept. 		We start with the ball and the kid playing forward. Our center passes him the ball right in front of the net and he shoots and scores. Our fans went crazy, we mobbed him in celebration, and I've never seen him so ecstatic. 		Our coach didn't allow us to score a goal for the rest of the game out of respect. That's definitely one of my favorite memories of my year playing soccer. 
Highschool isn't that badMy seven year old son has autism. He spends part of the day in the regular classroom and part of the day in the learning centre for children with special needs.  Sometimes a child from the regular classroom can come to the learning centre with him, and according to his teacher all his classmatess are really enthusiastic about it. 		Having a child on the spectrum is hard, but I have found that most people are very understanding. 
Highschool isn't that badMy High School was a bad school. Everything short of "Bringing weapons to school" happened on a near daily basis, including fights and rampant drug issues.		But nobody ever, *ever* fucked with any of the Special Needs kids.		It wasn't done. If you did something to them, you would have the full wrath of each and every student in the school. They were untouchable, in the good sense of that word.		The "wannabe Gangbangers" shared their lunches. The "Party Crowd" cheered them on when they did something that might require a little confidence. The "nerds" saved them seats and helped them with their school work.		In short, the school treated them like they had value. Because they do. Even if some of them would never grow up to have the traditional "contribute to society" adulthood, there is someone that cares about them, and someone who's life is enriched by knowing them.		Several of these kids *did* end up having the traditional adulthood alluded to. One gives motivational speeches about overcoming learning disabilities. Another works with charities and foundations to help young Autistic Children. I'd like to think it's because they were taught to value themselves in High School.
Highschool isn't that badI thought high school was awful, at the time. In retrospect, there was one guy who made fun of me... 4-5 times, without ever getting physical. People gave me numerous chances to get involved in things like sports and social activities. I was so massively insecure that I thought they were all making fun of me. I was encouraged to run for student office. Popular kids deliberately went out of their way to ask me if I was interested in various student events and functions. 		I really wish my head hadn't been so far up my own ass in HS. I might've had a good time.
Highschool isn't that badIn 3rd grade there was an autistic girl in our class named Zoey.  Zoey always laughed at everything in class and me and a few friends made it our daily job to keep Zoey's laugh meter topped off everyday no matter what it took.  The beginning of the year it was fairly easy to make her laugh; fake falls, chomping on the food, silly faces, all that stuff.  Later on we had to get more elaborate because she was becoming a little numb to the same old stuff.  We progressed to pretending that and invisible man was karate kicking the shit out of us and she absolutely loved that.  We were eventually told to calm down with the comedy act because it was starting to hinder her learning, which we understood.   But that didn't stop us from being Zoey's personal group of laugh material.  We came up with many different ways to amuse her and it worked everytime.  She would cry laughing and we would feel like awesome people for keeping Zoey happy.  The next year she switched schools and I never found out what happened to her after 3rd grade.  But I use the same laugh material I used with Zoey on my little cousins and they go nuts for it.  I was so happy to have an experience like that because it's such a feel good experience of my life that never fails to make me smile when thinking about it.  Sometimes autistic kids influence our lives in ways we could never do to others.
Highschool isn't that badMy friends and I hold a movie night every Saturday. One time one of my friends brings a mentally disabled guy with him. At first it was a little rough but this guy is the most gentle and kind person you will ever know. We all instantly accepted him as one of our own and put him in the rotation for picking movies. He loves movies, his favorites being Richard linklater films and the guy who did la la land and whiplash. If it wasn't for him my favorite movie wouldn't be whiplash. I am thankful every day that this bald angel is in my life.

Highschool isn't that badThere was a boy in my high school with Down syndrome who was the most genuine and wholesome spirit you could ever meet. He had a huge passion for everything he did, and he really loved his school and the people there. Everyone really liked him too and appreciated his spirit. When we were seniors, he was elected as homecoming king, and you could just see the sheer happiness in his face.

I just hope that society will accept him for the wonderful and amazing person that he is. It scares me people will make fun of him. He has an amazing memory, can climb anything you ask him to climb, can draw anything you want, and can give you directions to get wherever you want even if he's not been. He also knows all the states and capitals and countries and oceans, I could go on and on. 		I hope people will learn to love him just how he is. 
Highschool isn't that badThere was a girl in my graduating class. I don't know if she was autistic or not, but she had some pretty severe learning disabilities. Anyways at prom she was standing in the corner doing a lot of nothing. So I walked over and asked her to dance and she shut me down cold.		So I made my way back to my group and that was it.		Well our moms worked together and her mom came to mine one day thanking her. Apparently, she talked about it for two weeks how she turned me down, and it made her entire night. 		
Highschool isn't that badReminds me of this. 		https://youtu.be/MDOfgVqiQbw		Makes me so happy that not all schools are as shitty as mine was. The whole be the change you want to see in the world is such a beautiful thing when carried out 		Edit: video was removed off YouTube here's a new link (sorry it's so long)		https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.insideedition.com/headlines/20535-classmates-gift-special-needs-student-two-new-pairs-of-shoes-when-they-realize-his-are/amp?client=safari
Highschool isn't that badGosh the people in these threads are so lucky. The kids in my school were little fucking monsters
Highschool isn't that badYou know what that is? That's a couple key leaders deciding to have his back and everyone else goes with it.  With other leaders, it might bring out the worst in people, but make no mistake about it: it's always a couple cool kids that are actually, genuinely cool people, not preoccupied with bullshit.  		Kudos to them for being genuine leaders.
Highschool isn't that badNot autism, but at my middle school one of the custodians, named Mikey, rode my bus with me and had down syndrome. I would always say hello to him and he was a really great guy, always kind to everyone. Well, one day the principle came into lunch and said that Mikey was gonna play a song for us. So he came out into the cafetorium and played a song on his guitar and sang. My friends and I clapped for him and said good job to him afterward, but you could see some of the popular kids doing these things in a facetious manner. Sometimes kids aren't that great. 
Highschool isn't that badThis post brought you to by Hot Wheels.  Which is totally cool. Cause I love Hot Wheels too 
Highschool isn't that badWe had an autistic boy in my high school who would study the yearbook. He learned everybody's name and would say hi to people by name as they walked past. (He asked for the names of freshman, and was pretty good at remembering) Everybody loved him because he was so friendly. We made him our homecoming king too. 
Highschool isn't that badThere's this slightly (idk) autistic kid in my computer science class that would love to talk about computers		I would always listen to him and ask questions since I knew what he was talking about		He was nice :) 
Highschool isn't that badSometimes I read something like this and half way through I think to myself "Is this /r/wholesomememes or /r/unexpected?"  I love it when it's /r/wholesomememes =)
Highschool isn't that badThat's awesome 
Highschool isn't that badIn my experience, the outgoing kids were generally nice people. Also, there was no "popular crowd". Then again, I didn't go to an upper-middle class white school.
Highschool isn't that badHigh School ain't bad if the alpha kids are good people. That's rare though.
Highschool isn't that badMy older brother has Down syndrome. He was very popular among many of the "popular" kids, and not in a condescending way, they were genuinely kind people (and still are to this day). I think the fact that many of these "popular" kids in HS genuinely liked him prevented some bullying and helped him through what is a tough period for just about everyone. One guy in particular was in my bro's grade and was a star athlete. He still calls my brother every couple weeks and makes sure to stop by and shoots some hoops with him when he's in town (one of the friendliest people I've known). My brother graduated from HS almost a decade ago at this point and his friend still takes the effort to keep in touch. 
Highschool isn't that badI'm not crying, you're crying ;-;
Highschool isn't that badAt my old highschool we had a girl had special needs. She was in classes the other special needs students were in. In her Junior year she won Junior Princess for homecoming. During the annocment and her crowning everyone stood up and gave her a standing ovation. I remember the teachers talked to all of us during the nominations to make sure we weren't trying to be mean. The students were legitimately wanted to nominate her. 
Highschool isn't that bad        At our high school we have this kid named Robbie who is possibly the best person who could ever attend. He's the most popular kid in school and knows everyones name. He'll say hi whenever he sees you and it warms your heart every time. He's a three sport athlete, playing football, wrestling, and baseball. Every once in a while a team will let him win a match or score a point and I challenge you to find a louder crowd than in those moments. 	        I couldn't imagine school without him and I can't imagine him being anywhere else. He gets daily attention, every student and faculty member is there to look out for him and it will be a sad time this year when he graduates. All we can hope is that wherever he goes next, they treat Robbie with the same enthusiasm we all do but I'm not sure if any place will be able to compare. Robbie is lucky that his parents picked us as his high school, and the school is beyond blessed to have him in our student body. 		I just wanted to share:)		Edit: commas
Highschool isn't that badI was at a High School graduation one time. A girl who had Down syndrome received her diploma. 		Well your not supposed to cheer or yell until the end...	She got a standing ovation starting with her classmates and eventually the whole gym was on their feet. 		It was a good couple of minutes, we were cheering and yelling her name.		Probably, the highlight of that girls who life.	Still get chills and misty eyed thinking about it. 		
Highschool isn't that badEveryone always says that high school is awful and that the popular kids rule and that everyone is mean and such, but from my experience, that only happened in the movies. It wasn't that bad at all in real life. People were generally, you know... people. They weren't saints but they were nice. I liked high school.
Highschool isn't that badI have an autistic cousin who was recently included in the football team. On his birthday, all of the team came out and gave him gifts.  They made sure he had everything in order and got excited whenever he got excited.  It was truly heart warming to see him so included instead of ostracized like some mentally handicapped people can be.  
Highschool isn't that badi was the token autistic child in school and instead of this i just got rocks thrown at me ("fossils") because I would spend all recess looking at rocks for fossilized shells rather than play with other kids. :/		i did find a lot of cool fossils though.
Highschool isn't that badMan, what did we do to deserve such an amazing subreddit. 
Highschool isn't that badAt my high school, we have an entire basketball team for kids with special needs, and there's actually a league for it in our area. It's super fun and all the kids that play regular sports come out and support and go nuts, it's a blast!
Highschool isn't that badI went to school with Grant from 6th grade until we graduated in 2001. Grant had autism and wasn't always in the same classes as the rest of the kids. But we all knew him and not one person was ever mean to him. Grant loved the show "Home Improvement" passionately. His favorite friends he would greet by doing the grunting noise that Tim the Tool Man Taylor would do. He was verbal otherwise but we probably all looked silly grunting like that at each other 
Highschool isn't that badThat's wonderful! Seems like an alternative universe to me after my experiences at high schools though :/
Highschool isn't that badAt my high school there's a dude named Kyle. Very sociable, easy to talk to, the guy's just enjoyable. I've talked to him enough to know he's in special ed, and he speaks in a specific way where you can kinda tell there's something... different about him. Not necessarily bad, just either an odd personality or there's something different about his brain. No matter how enjoyable the conversation is, you can tell. 		And I swear this guy's talked to everyone in the school. I've barely seen anyone who wasn't delighted talking to this guy. And just like the story in the post, he became homecoming king. 	I'm lucky to live in western washington, in a very accepting, kind, and small community where something like this is even possible.
Highschool isn't that badMy high school elected a boy with really severe down syndrome our homecoming king. He got to dance with the prettiest, kindest, most popular girl in the school and she was smiling and laughing the whole time. I was really damn proud of my school for that. Just thought I'd share :)
Highschool isn't that badThis whole thread is so freaking wholesome :)
Highschool isn't that badHot Wheels is legit awesome
Highschool isn't that badWe had a kid with autism in our school, and he was in my grade. He also won prom king for our junior prom, I think its an expected and agreed upon thing by most of the people in the grade for him to win. 
Highschool isn't that badNow we wait for the inevitable 4chan greentext from the boys perspective
Highschool isn't that badMy highschool had a girl who was always teased.  She was pale skin, red hair, not charismatic, or especially smart or attractive.  I was in her grade, and watched over the years as people treated her poorly.  She seemed too frail for the world, you know the type.  		After piling shit on her for 17 years, they made her homecoming queen, not because they wanted her to feel good, but because they wanted her to be a spectacle, to get one last nasty laugh off.  		
Highschool isn't that bad(F) When I was a freshman in high school, people found out that I had autism. I was bullied so bad by groups of people and I spent a week in the hospital on suicide watch. And none of the bullies ever got detention. But still good to see that high school isn't bad for everyone. 
Highschool isn't that badDoes anyone else think that the whole "vote the autistic kid Homecoming King/Queen" trope is really patronizing?
My school had an autistic boy who loved to sing and dance. He had a helper who helped keep him focused during classes and assemblies, but it was very difficult for him to sit still and silent that long. He just wanted to sing!		When we were sophomores the school started this policy where they would have daily morning assemblies we would have to sit through. They were all presentations about on how to succeed in school, be a good person, etc. One was about fire safety. They were the worst. But they were especially bad for this kid, who had to sit still and silent for a whole forty-five minutes first thing in the morning EVERY SINGLE DAY. It was awful. The guy started misbehaving in class, throwing tantrums pretty much every day. You could see the tension on his face. It was not a good time.		Anyway, I have no idea who thought of it but eventually it became the tradition that whenever the presentation wrapped up, in whatever time we had left before first classes, the autistic guy could come up on stage and perform for the school. It was easily the best part of those terrible assemblies, the kid had a blast and the audience fucking loved it. He really was a good singer, and you could just feel the joy he had getting to do his favorite thing and have people go nuts for it. The tradition stuck even after the school nixed those godawful morning assemblies, and iirc they even let him sing at our graduation. That's fantastic that he could do that :)

He would just bust his moves at morning break and lunch. He never cared who was watching, or if anyone noticed. Needless to say, though, everyone passing by noticed, and most cheered him on. If they didn't stop to cheer, they smiled or simply ignored him as they went on with their day. No one ever said anything mean about it to him. 		I'm not sure what he's up to these days, but from what I do know, he's happy and that's what matters.

That absolutely wasn't the case for me and it makes me happy that others had the same experience.  I always felt like my classmates were very conscientious of the kids who were in need of special consideration for whatever reason, and it wasn't even ever something that was officially acknowledged or discussed.  It was just understood.  People are good, people.

In my old middle school there's a very sweet autistic boy named Xavier and when I was in the 8th grade he was in the 6th. We always passed each other in the halls and he'd always say "big guy!!" and I'd give him a big high five and be like "what's up little man" or something. It was always so nice to have my day brightened up by just those two words, so since my high school is connected to the middle school I'll go down to his room at lunch every once and a while and just talk with him. He always shares these really great stories about his "adventures" with other kids and it just warms my heart that everyone else is so kind to him. Love ya Xavier. :)Likewise there was a mentally challenged kid at my highschool named Kyle who every passing period would go out into the hallways and say hey guys! And give high fives to a ton of people. He was always cheerful and kind and everyone was nice to him. To make it better his classroom was by the main vending machines, cafeteria and main office so there were hundreds of people passing him and he would catch as many as he could!

Okay now I want to talk about David. 		David went to my middle school and was a completely blind Korean boy that reminds me of Chirrut Imwe from Rogue One (whose character is also a blind Asian guy). Watching that movie has made me think about him a lot lately. Well David would always request sitting next to me in class. He was the friendliest dude ever. David's jedi power was thumb wrestling. He had an incredibly hightened sense for the muscles in the hand, and where they would move next. Dude was the pinball wizard of thumb wrestling. Even the teachers couldn't beat him. He would also hold out his hand and be able to tell who you were just by a handshake. 		I'll always remember this one time, my birthday, when David stopped my eighth grade language arts class to sing me happy birthday in Korean Opera. Best day ever. I don't remember his last name, or know where he is now, but that dude was as pure as they come, and I hope he's doing well. "The pinball wizard of thumb wrestling"		I love it

It only takes one "cool" kid to do something nice like this and everyone else will follow. This post got me thinking about why packs of highschool kids are sometimes mean and why they're sometimes awesome like in this post. I think you're right -- it's inertia and it just takes an initial prod in the right direction from one of us with the right outlook.

There was an autistic kid on my varsity soccer team. Unofficially, he was our manager and was meant to just sort of hang out with the coaches and carry some of the equipment around during practice, but we always included him whenever we could and if we were winning by enough, we would get him out on the field for the last few minutes. 		One game, we were crushing the other team-- I'm talking like 10-0 by the first half-- and as we start our warm-ups for the second half, the other team's captains came over to our coach with a proposition. They wanted to let the autistic kid score a goal at the beginning of the half. We're a bit caught off guard but we obviously accept. 		We start with the ball and the kid playing forward. Our center passes him the ball right in front of the net and he shoots and scores. Our fans went crazy, we mobbed him in celebration, and I've never seen him so ecstatic. 		Our coach didn't allow us to score a goal for the rest of the game out of respect. That's definitely one of my favorite memories of my year playing soccer. Props to the other team for that idea and a perfect willingness to propose it. Can't imagine many people who when down 10-0 would even think of something so kind!

My seven year old son has autism. He spends part of the day in the regular classroom and part of the day in the learning centre for children with special needs.  Sometimes a child from the regular classroom can come to the learning centre with him, and according to his teacher all his classmatess are really enthusiastic about it. 		Having a child on the spectrum is hard, but I have found that most people are very understanding. My 8 year old twins have autism.  They love the times in which they get to go to the big classroom.  Most everyone is supportive and kind to them.

It was fun.
My High School was a bad school. Everything short of "Bringing weapons to school" happened on a near daily basis, including fights and rampant drug issues.		But nobody ever, *ever* fucked with any of the Special Needs kids.		It wasn't done. If you did something to them, you would have the full wrath of each and every student in the school. They were untouchable, in the good sense of that word.		The "wannabe Gangbangers" shared their lunches. The "Party Crowd" cheered them on when they did something that might require a little confidence. The "nerds" saved them seats and helped them with their school work.		In short, the school treated them like they had value. Because they do. Even if some of them would never grow up to have the traditional "contribute to society" adulthood, there is someone that cares about them, and someone who's life is enriched by knowing them.		Several of these kids *did* end up having the traditional adulthood alluded to. One gives motivational speeches about overcoming learning disabilities. Another works with charities and foundations to help young Autistic Children. I'd like to think it's because they were taught to value themselves in High School.I went to a high school like this with the unspoken agreement of not messing with any of the special needs kids. One kid didn't the memo but he learned soon enough.		The school would have music playing in the quad during lunch breaks after pep rallies. During one lunch break, they happened to be playing Michael Jackson and one of the special needs kids got up on stage in the middle of the quad and started dancing. The students around were watching him and cheering him on when some "cool kid" known for his good dancing skills jumped on stage to engage in a dance battle. The first kid didn't have good moves and it was obvious the second guy was just trying to show him up. 		Everyone cheered for the first guy as loud as they could to declare him the clear winner of the dance battle. Second guy got off stage and some of the football players were giving him grief for getting on stage to begin with. 		It was one of the best days of high school for me. 
My High School was a bad school. Everything short of "Bringing weapons to school" happened on a near daily basis, including fights and rampant drug issues.		But nobody ever, *ever* fucked with any of the Special Needs kids.		It wasn't done. If you did something to them, you would have the full wrath of each and every student in the school. They were untouchable, in the good sense of that word.		The "wannabe Gangbangers" shared their lunches. The "Party Crowd" cheered them on when they did something that might require a little confidence. The "nerds" saved them seats and helped them with their school work.		In short, the school treated them like they had value. Because they do. Even if some of them would never grow up to have the traditional "contribute to society" adulthood, there is someone that cares about them, and someone who's life is enriched by knowing them.		Several of these kids *did* end up having the traditional adulthood alluded to. One gives motivational speeches about overcoming learning disabilities. Another works with charities and foundations to help young Autistic Children. I'd like to think it's because they were taught to value themselves in High School.For a lot of these kids high school really is the end for them, so it's nice to see that people will take the time to make it enjoyable. 
I thought high school was awful, at the time. In retrospect, there was one guy who made fun of me... 4-5 times, without ever getting physical. People gave me numerous chances to get involved in things like sports and social activities. I was so massively insecure that I thought they were all making fun of me. I was encouraged to run for student office. Popular kids deliberately went out of their way to ask me if I was interested in various student events and functions. 		I really wish my head hadn't been so far up my own ass in HS. I might've had a good time.Same here bud...  It's hard being in your head all the time. I wish I had let myself relax a bit more as well.

I really wish my head hadn't been so far up my own ass in HS. I might've had a good time.I had the same issue.  One thing that gets me as an adult...  I have a bit of a speech impediment I'm always self conscious about.  There was a girl in high school...  Every time we crossed paths, she'd say "Hi (Lexilogical)!!" with the same impediment and a huge wave. I'd always give her a bit of a polite wave and a "hi" back.		Seven years after graduating, it occurred to me that maybe she just had the same impediment.  I always assumed she was mocking me.  Never even learned her name.		
My friends and I hold a movie night every Saturday. One time one of my friends brings a mentally disabled guy with him. At first it was a little rough but this guy is the most gentle and kind person you will ever know. We all instantly accepted him as one of our own and put him in the rotation for picking movies. He loves movies, his favorites being Richard linklater films and the guy who did la la land and whiplash. If it wasn't for him my favorite movie wouldn't be whiplash. I am thankful every day that this bald angel is in my life.That's very kind of you and your friends!
I had such a shitty time in high school, so it always makes me smile to know that other people had nice times and were generally cool bros with each other. :)Hope everything's all good with you now, high school isn't always easy :)

The varsity football team are the sweetest guys! I have a weight training class with a bunch of them. They weren't patronizing towards me because I was weaker, or because I'm a girl. They just... Supported me. And still do.		Makes me feel good whenever I think about it :-)

I live in Chile (and school is pretty different to  the us) and I hear pretty often that people had a bad time in high school,  do you mean the test you had to take,  or were people(teachers) mean etc? 		Thank you very much

There was a boy in my high school with Down syndrome who was the most genuine and wholesome spirit you could ever meet. He had a huge passion for everything he did, and he really loved his school and the people there. Everyone really liked him too and appreciated his spirit. When we were seniors, he was elected as homecoming king, and you could just see the sheer happiness in his face.Our homecoming king was a guy with duchenne muscular dystrophy. In a small town everybody grows up together and everybody knows everybody. It was pretty rough seeing the kid who was the fastest runner in kindergarten not be able to walk unaided by 7th grade. He was in a wheelchair fulltime by our sophomore year.		Honestly, he wasn't the brightest guy, but I sometimes wonder how much of that was because he didn't bother studying since he'd assumed he should have died years before from his condition. On the surface, though, he was a very friendly, happy-go-lucky dude.		He pretty unanimously won homecoming king senior year. As we grow up, we make strong bonds with those who we share activities with, like playing sports or performing the fine arts. He couldn't do any of that, but pretty much everyone had grown up with him and it's hard to forget your first friend.		Last I checked he's still kicking and we're almost at our 10 year reunion.
Warms my <3Spending a few minutes reading OP and the stories in the comments actually brightened my day. Thank you, /r/wholesomememes.
My son collects legos. Wish it was hot wheels because that would be way more inexpensive! 		I just hope that society will accept him for the wonderful and amazing person that he is. It scares me people will make fun of him. He has an amazing memory, can climb anything you ask him to climb, can draw anything you want, and can give you directions to get wherever you want even if he's not been. He also knows all the states and capitals and countries and oceans, I could go on and on. 		I hope people will learn to love him just how he is. A /r/Lego mod is autistic, and often shares great stories about living with the condition. 	<3 	I think her username is unusualsoup? Idk. It was a total blast reading her insightful comments on an askreddit thread this week. Might give you hope!

There was a girl in my graduating class. I don't know if she was autistic or not, but she had some pretty severe learning disabilities. Anyways at prom she was standing in the corner doing a lot of nothing. So I walked over and asked her to dance and she shut me down cold.		So I made my way back to my group and that was it.		Well our moms worked together and her mom came to mine one day thanking her. Apparently, she talked about it for two weeks how she turned me down, and it made her entire night. 		That's unexpectedly awesome 
Reminds me of this. 		https://youtu.be/MDOfgVqiQbw		Makes me so happy that not all schools are as shitty as mine was. The whole be the change you want to see in the world is such a beautiful thing when carried out 		Edit: video was removed off YouTube here's a new link (sorry it's so long)		https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.insideedition.com/headlines/20535-classmates-gift-special-needs-student-two-new-pairs-of-shoes-when-they-realize-his-are/amp?client=safariI'm not crying....you're crying....
Not autism, but at my middle school one of the custodians, named Mikey, rode my bus with me and had down syndrome. I would always say hello to him and he was a really great guy, always kind to everyone. Well, one day the principle came into lunch and said that Mikey was gonna play a song for us. So he came out into the cafetorium and played a song on his guitar and sang. My friends and I clapped for him and said good job to him afterward, but you could see some of the popular kids doing these things in a facetious manner. Sometimes kids aren't that great. That's really awesome actually.		I'm still in high school. I'm on the spectrum myself. Not enough to need any extra help in school, or very noticeable if you talked to me now. However, in relation to people who are well known and out there (not popular per say), there are people that are awesome, and the "I go out and party on Mondays (not kidding)" crowd. The latter I've had issues with over the years. 		Ever since late elementary school, where I did need extra help, I was labeled as the "autistic" kid. For that crowd, defined pretty early, if you are autistic, you are treated very condescendingly, almost like a preschooler, amongst your peers. I won't go into much, but there have been a few times where people have said I was mentally retarded. almost expecting me to not notice or hear, even tho I was right in front of them. Once we hit middle school, the special needs kids of my school were just flat-out ignored, contrary to the attention we received in elementary school (for me this was a relief). This still continues to now.		Occasionally tho I would have a few classes with my "helpers" every now and then, even more condescending and ignoring then ever before. A pattern I noticed was that if they do decide to talk to you, they do it either to fuck with you, glorify you to god-like levels, or to show they were a good person (lol). All three I have experienced to this day, even tho it's obvious to anyone who would meet me even a couple of years ago that I was normal and aware.		Some days I feel worthless, especially when I have to talk to some of these type of people. But then, even tho I'm autistic, I like to tell myself, I'm a better person than these people:			I've overcome autism to become a normal human being			I've played tennis on varsity since freshman year			I have great friends, from my school and others, that treat me like a normal human being, and willing to listen and help me out			I can take care of and be adored by any little kid within a matter of minutes (good skill to have as a guy lmao)			I have a bright future ahead of me			I am loved by many			It gets me through the day		It absolutely warms my heart to see these types of actions that the OP described. It shows to me that my school is just one against many schools who have great people treating someone with special needs like an actual human, not an object. When I talk to some of the other "autistic" kids that I grew up with, I notice they are some of the sweetest, non-judgmental, happiest people here, and the way they get used absolutely breaks my heart. This entire thread is honestly inspiring me to do something about it, be their friend or something, because they need it more than I do, and who cares what others think?
In my experience, the outgoing kids were generally nice people. Also, there was no "popular crowd". Then again, I didn't go to an upper-middle class white school.I went to an upper-middle class white public school and it was like that too. I think it all just depends. The private Christian school I went to before that had absolutely horrible people who frequented trying to hurt people. I think I'm many of those situations just a few people can make a huge difference.
(F) When I was a freshman in high school, people found out that I had autism. I was bullied so bad by groups of people and I spent a week in the hospital on suicide watch. And none of the bullies ever got detention. But still good to see that high school isn't bad for everyone. that's not very wholesome :/		i hope life is treating you better now, though		and, as someone who isn't autistic but has been reported to multiple different authorities for suicidal thoughts, feelings & actions, i know how you feel		and if it helps the mood, kids at most schools (at least those i've been involved with) are relatively friendly to autistic people. they might not be treated amicably or with as much camaraderie as non-disabled students, but at the very least they aren't bullied or alienated.

We all stand up for one another- community is family. I hope I can help make my handful of autistic classmates' experiences better than yours :-)
Does anyone else think that the whole "vote the autistic kid Homecoming King/Queen" trope is really patronizing?let's spend four years ignoring a person and then use one night to prove to everyone how morally righteous we are. thanks, kid, for letting us use you to feel good about ourselves. validation validation gimme
That's fantastic that he could do that :)That boys name... Kanye West.
oh my god, how did they have 45 minutes worth of presentations every day?I have no idea. I never paid attention to more than the first five minutes. 		They might've been shorter than that. This was a while ago, so I could just be remembering how long they felt (about 7,000 years).		One time the vice principal just talked about how much he like to sit on tables. I went to a terrible school.
oh my god, how did they have 45 minutes worth of presentations every day?This is the real question. Jesus Christ.
Was there a particular musician he favored?Himself
Was there a particular musician he favored?I don't think so. He mostly sang popular songs we all heard on the radio. But he LOVED to do the moonwalk.
We had a dancer at our high school, too. 		He would just bust his moves at morning break and lunch. He never cared who was watching, or if anyone noticed. Needless to say, though, everyone passing by noticed, and most cheered him on. If they didn't stop to cheer, they smiled or simply ignored him as they went on with their day. No one ever said anything mean about it to him. 		I'm not sure what he's up to these days, but from what I do know, he's happy and that's what matters.  Is this kid Jimmy Pesto? 
Movies always make high school kids out to be demons.  That absolutely wasn't the case for me and it makes me happy that others had the same experience.  I always felt like my classmates were very conscientious of the kids who were in need of special consideration for whatever reason, and it wasn't even ever something that was officially acknowledged or discussed.  It was just understood.  People are good, people.Oddly, in malcolm in the middle, a ton of the students were always incredibly nice kids (one made a fundraiser when malcolm was poor)

Likewise there was a mentally challenged kid at my highschool named Kyle who every passing period would go out into the hallways and say hey guys! And give high fives to a ton of people. He was always cheerful and kind and everyone was nice to him. To make it better his classroom was by the main vending machines, cafeteria and main office so there were hundreds of people passing him and he would catch as many as he could!A little different but I worked a stint at the Adult Education Easter Seals Center in my town several years back. It's nothing like what I ended up doing with my life but it will probably always be my favorite job I've ever had. Every day I'd show up and everyone would run over and hug me, telling me all about their day so far. Eventually I started showing up early to play basketball outside with them just because I liked being around them. I *wanted* to go to work and I've never experienced anything like that. 		I love my career in IT and everyone at my office these days but they don't gather to hug me when I stumble in early every morning. I miss it.

Joey as everybody called him. You would talk to him and while sometimes he would be completely coherent and normal other times he would just talk nonsense. Nice kid though, always had a good attitude and was willing to chat with anybody. 		Anyway, this kid loved cars. Like race cars and hot rods. So people would talk to him about cars and get him all hyped up and then tell him to 'REV EM UP JOEY' or 'GIVE EM HELL JOEY' or some variation. At that point Joey would start making very loud engine revving noises and then a tire burnout noise as he would take off sprinting down the hall amidst the between class traffic. It was just the right amount of chaos to make everyone grin. We always welcomed him in to talk when we were standing around bullshitting.

This post got me thinking about why packs of highschool kids are sometimes mean and why they're sometimes awesome like in this post. I think you're right -- it's inertia and it just takes an initial prod in the right direction from one of us with the right outlook.It's also not wanting to be left out; inherently having large groups is harder than having smaller groups of friends so people get into the defensive mentality of shutting out others so they don't get shut out themselves.

It's a small area, so nobody around us ever had decent teams and we had gone to state playoffs three years in a row, so we would really beat up on other schools because there was no competition. 		When they came over some of us were joking that they were forfeiting. After we heard their plan, we all shut up. 		Hell, some of them even came out to root for us in the playoffs later that season. Those guys were pretty cool. Shout out to you, Union High School varsity soccer team. You guys were topnotch.

It was one of the best days of high school for me. We had a guy pull a chair out from under a special needs kid during lunch. 		The kid in our school that was known for fighting constantly, just walked up, slammed his head against an brick pillar and threw him out of a plexiglass window. 		It was quite the scene. He ended up getting suspended, but the first kid ended up getting expelled so it all worked out in the end. 
Hope everything's all good with you now, high school isn't always easy :)I got help for some problems I have (which I highly encourage anyone reading this to seek out if they need it!) and I out of some unhealthy situations. Thank you for you concern! :) I hope you have a lovely day, friend!
I'm in high school right now. The varsity football team are the sweetest guys! I have a weight training class with a bunch of them.

Makes me feel good whenever I think about it :-)Regardless of what memes and reddit likes to think football players are pretty normal guys. My friends and I (years and years ago) were the core of our state tournament team and all we did was play Smash Bros and Diablo in our free time.

On a positive note, atmospheric concentrations of CFCs are on track to being back to where they were in the 80s, and these are pretty much the biggest cause of global warming.

Remember when Francis became a responsible ranch hand, disappointing his brothers when they came to visit by not giving in to their reckless desires? And a drunken Otto took a despondent Hal out to the desert, where they promptly got lost. Meanwhile Dewey had stolen a figurine from Gretchen and carelessly broke it, and upon seeing her tearful reaction his guilt and empathy overcame him so he started cleaning until he bled? Then just when it looked like Hal and Otto were dead, Francis subconsciously triggered Malcolm and Reese's massive fireworks display and lit up the night sky, accidentally providing a compass for Otto and Hal to return to the ranch. Also one of the ranch hands from that episode is Oscar from the Office.		Man I fuckign love Malcolm in the Middle. PM or comment if you'd like me to write a story synopsis for your favorite episode.

Regardless of what memes and reddit likes to think football players are pretty normal guys. My friends and I (years and years ago) were the core of our state tournament team and all we did was play Smash Bros and Diablo in our free time.Yeah, they're all actual dorks- I love them XD
When people talk about hating high school, it's usually because of bullying from other kids. Or they just had no friends or social life
Tell me, is it true that being smart and maybe a little nerdy is what's cool these days? I grew up in the 80s and that idea seems so wild to me. 		But I'd love it to be true. Yes, it's true! I'm guiltly of being both, actually. 		 Being a douchebag doesn't fly anymore. Most kids aren't afraid of calling someone out for being a jackass. It's wonderful to watch people stick up for one another.		What's really "cool" is being *passionate*. The kid in the robotics club and the kid who's the lacrosse player may be in different friend groups, but neither is seen as better than the other. They're both just doing what they love, and we respect that. And I think that's really beautiful.		It's weird, but I honestly love talking about being a modern day teen with the older generations.

But I'd love it to be true. It seems like high school it a lot less tiered. Sure there are friend groups of jocks and friend groups of theater kids, but there is no feeling that one is above the other.

But I'd love it to be true. I graduated in 08, but it seemed like it was really heading in that direction when I went. We didn't really have "the popular kids." Everyone was just sort of another student to each other. Sure, there were groups. You had the band kids, the ROTC kids, the jocks, the computer nerds, etc. I hung out with the punks and the skaters. People tend to hang out with others that have similar interests. But even then, most people were friends with everyone else. I did theater, and my senior year for the musical we had a few people from the football team join. Our lead male roll was one of the seniors on the team. 		Hell, one of the nominees for prom king was also one of the kids that would have been picked on for being a nerds had it been back in the 70s or 80s(assuming the stereotypes of how school was are true). People didn't do it because they wanted to make themselves feel better, or because they felt bad for him. He was just really friendly and was good friends with most of the school. One of the things that people liked about him was that he was really smart. He always had good grades, he helped other students out. 		Honestly, I just watched Freaks and Geeks for the first time about a month ago. While I thought it was an amazing show and wish there was more, it was weird seeing kids getting bullied the way they were. We didn't have many kids like that, and they were generally called out for it.

Don't judge them too harshly, the world we live in now is very different than the one that many boomers grew up in. On a positive note, atmospheric concentrations of CFCs are on track to being back to where they were in the 80s, and these are pretty much the biggest cause of global warming. Chin up man, the world is how you look at it :)Apportioning blame doesn't solve problems. We can spend our generation working out exactly who is to blame for what, or we can accept that there are things that need to be fixed and focus our energy on making things better.

This doesn't add to the conversation whatsoever but I'm never not-upvoting something related to Malcolm in the Middle. 		Remember when Francis became a responsible ranch hand, disappointing his brothers when they came to visit by not giving in to their reckless desires? And a drunken Otto took a despondent Hal out to the desert, where they promptly got lost. Meanwhile Dewey had stolen a figurine from Gretchen and carelessly broke it, and upon seeing her tearful reaction his guilt and empathy overcame him so he started cleaning until he bled? Then just when it looked like Hal and Otto were dead, Francis subconsciously triggered Malcolm and Reese's massive fireworks display and lit up the night sky, accidentally providing a compass for Otto and Hal to return to the ranch. Also one of the ranch hands from that episode is Oscar from the Office.		Man I fuckign love Malcolm in the Middle. PM or comment if you'd like me to write a story synopsis for your favorite episode.I was gonna add something else to the comment and I trailed off and forgot what I was gonna say in the first place.		Anyway my fav episode is the time where reese did something So Horrible everyone gave bits of the story and everyone was shocked and disgusted and no one ever said what it was

I'm not sure if I just got lucky but almost all of the kids are good to one another. There's still fights and people getting fed up but for the most part it's due to personal circumstances and never because someone is a "nerd" or gay or anything like that. Overall, our school is very accepting and pretty fun to be a part of.
I'm making a lasagna... For one. For your information there's an inflammation in my tear gland. 
Profound is a valid descriptor for levels of cognitive impairment. "Retarded" has fallen out of fashion, but you will still hear it among some professionals and among families that received a diagnosis when this word was still used."Profound mental retardation", "profound MR" are still used descriptively in healthcare. Not sure if the ICD-10 still uses retardation as a diagnosis--probably not? Developmentally disabled is used a lot. "Profoundly retarded" tells me a lot more about the level of cognitive function vs developmentally disabled.		I personally don't think it's offensive in the healthcare setting, but then again there are plenty o' people who get their diapers in a wad if you call adult briefs diapers instead of briefs. In one catholic hospital where I did nursing school clinicals we had to call the urine pans that you set in the toilet a "speci-pan" because the nuns got offended that we called them "hats".  I call 'em peepans cause then everyone knows what your talking about.  Same with pads--whatchoo want? Eye pad? Vag pad? Abd pad? Pee pad? Be specific.		Actually, I just now remembered I had a pt today that had "mild retardation" listed in his health hx.
Back in the day, 'retarded' just meant 'suffers from retardation' People like to twist words to fit their need to belittle people, and as such it's now widely derogatory.		The same thing happened with 'lame' and 'special'I don't think a lot of people today know that "lame" as an insult came from the age of polio, when kids playing stickball called the slowpoke "lame" and their parents would get upset. Polio has been eradicated for so long that I don't think there's any stigma around the word lame unless you're older.

I hated that show when I was younger but one episode really stood out to me. It was the one in which Reese or Dewey become a really good chef. I think there was a part where they declined going out to hang with their friends because they just wanted to make good food. That episode was really interesting, and it's the only one I remember. Could you make a synopsis on that, please?Sounds like Thanksgiving. Earlier in the series, Reese had discovered his own genius in the form of a mastery of cooking and baking. As the resident chef, he is tasked with fixing the family's Thanksgiving dinner.  He enlists his younger brother Dewey and his father Hal to help, riding them hard ala Gordon Ramsey. He aggravates them to the point of wanting to quit. Just when they are about to leave Reese to fend for himself, he gives them just a little taste of his sumptuous sauces, causing them to relent and absorb the abuse so long as a scrumptious meal of turkey monkfish is the light at the end of the tunnel. 		Francis and his wife Piama arrive, fighting non-stop. Lois is thrilled. She projects her self-hatred at Piama; instead of embracing her with kinship as she is a near carbon copy of Lois' personality. Francis' mommy issues are always at the forefront of his entire being. Hal begs Lois to help Francis and Piama make up, getting increasingly upset over it.		Meanwhile, Malcolm is invited to spend Thanksgiving with a hot blonde girl who says mean things to him all the time. He can't decide whether she is flirting, or just takes masochistic pleasure in being arch. But she is hot and he is horny, so he decides to let her abuse him. Reese, whose misbehavior stems in part from his repressed sexuality, isn't interested in the party which Malcolm can't understand. Malcolm always chooses to escape family whenever possible.		At the party, Malcolm gets drunk for the first time and it becomes clear that the hot girl is attracted to him. She tries to have sex with him in the twilight of her consciousness, but he declines; the family can be pretty scummy sometimes, but they certainly aren't rapists.		Malcolm stumbles home drunk, and interrupts his family's wonderful dinner exclaiming to them how he is drunk, but did not have sex, and might be gay! Then promptly throws up into the turkey monkfish, ruining Reese's ridiculously difficult effort. 		Francis councils Malcolm, reminding him that not taking advantage of a drunk girl is simply the right thing to do. As an apoplectic Hal frets over Francis' and Piama's fighting, Lois does the one and only thing she possibly could to help them get back on the same team-- she tells them they should break up. The couple, bound together in love and spite, immediately reconcile their differences as they realize who they should really be mad at: their parents.

I just wish that sometimes they would go out and try to find someone else in their lives.My best buddy's parents are just like that. Dad just hangs out in the basement and smokes and drinks and mom sits upstairs playing solitaire and watching TV. They don't eat together, don't talk and go days at a time without seeing each other.		He hates holidays because everything is so fake and forced and he's constantly back and forth between spending time with one or the other.		I think it has to do with the fact that when they were dropping him off to college he found out his dad wasn't his biological father and then later discovered his dad had a second family. 		They just played make believe for the first 18 years of his life but have secretly always hated him. Nobody has told his brother anything yet either which is pretty messed up. 		I'm of the opinion these situations would be better if people just knew when to go their separate ways.

I hope everything'w alright for you and your dad. What he said this time probably came from the bottom of his heart and even if he didn't exactly followed up with his action, I hope and believe he really thought what he said.		Sorry if it didn't make sense, I'm a bit emotional right now.
Well that's adorable! And I love that they're drinking wine at 7:30 Already drunk by 7:30. 		Probably in bed by 9. 		Living the dream. 
My wife doesn't like it when I call her friend, because "she doesn't sleep with her friends." I've compromised on girlfriend.Yeah I too try to not talk about my girlfriend to my wife.
A couple times during our relationship, my boyfriend was asked to attend weddings without me, which doesn't bother me because a) I get to hang around the house all day bra-less and b) I will get drunk texted and drunk called throughout the night with messages of him saying I'm his best friend. 		That guy wins.You can't go bra-less in your own home if your boyfriend is home?

Just came out of this and it's hard. But I know that I can get through it. At the moment I'm just scared I won't find that anywhere else.You're strong and can get through anything! :)
This sub makes me want to be nicer to my husband.I mean... why aren't you?
I know it's wholesome but it made me feel terrible because I know that will never happen in my family. Make a new family!
Why do people call it wine drunk if it's the same thing as being beer drunk or etcIt's a different type of drunk. Like how Tequila makes ppl think they're the best dancer in the world, or Rum makes ppl want to fight (etc) 	Wine drunk is usually a very mellow happy drunk. It's my personal favorite:)
Why do people call it wine drunk if it's the same thing as being beer drunk or etcBecause it is NOT the same as beer drunk.
Drunk is drunk. There's no such thing as wine drunk or whiskey drunk, it's all your head. The alcohol affects you the exact same way. Sorry to be nit picky but it's upsetting that we live in a supposedly educated society yet this nonsense still persists.its upsetting that people experience something, and for some reason it makes you angry, and you have to tell them they are wrong in an aggressive manner, even though ultimately, it doesn't fucking matter either way and makes no difference to anyone or anything, if people are convinced wine drunk is different to beer drunk.		not to mention there are plausible explanations for the difference. wine could have chemicals besides alcohol that cheer you up slightly, kind of like cacoa does. beer could not have those chemicals, and thus feel different. i tend to get sluggish and tired long before i get drunk on beer, which is probably the excess of carbs, which doesn't happen with wine, cause wine is stronger, and you get drunk quicker and ingest less unnecessary carbs. its entirely fucking plausible to feel different when the beverages have different levels of macro nutrients and possibly other chemicals which might affect mood, so cheer the fuck up and have some wine fucko.
I've always disliked it when people attribute their "significant other " as being their "Best Friend". You're not friends, you're lovers! which is so much more IMO. 		If you're calling your spouse your best friend, you probably don't have a best friend.The idea is that your SO is friend first before all else, that they're someone you enjoy spending your time with regardless of sex. Not all best friends are lovers, but all lovers are [ideally] best friends. 
My husband and I often do what we call being alone together. He'll be on his iPad and I'm reading, but we're still sitting on the couch and he'll occasionally show me cute animal pictures. Being married to your best friend is the best. > being alone together.		there is nothing nicer than this.

No pressure, no stress, just calm peaceful knowing that you both enjoy spending time together. We make fun of each other, we discuss things in which we both troll the other sometimes. He's more of a science person, I'm more of an imagination person, so I don't adhere to set scientific rules. It bugs him so much, it's hilarious. Whether we discuss hypothesis in science or fictional characters, it's fun, we could talk forever. We both know our strong points and our weak points and love each other for them. Having your best friend as a significant other is amazing. Seriously would remarry him over and over. He's awesome.

Love means a lot of things to different people, but to me, once you've stripped out everything else, the very last thing thats left is respect. All of the things that made you want to be with your partner can disappear overtime but what should be left is that level of respect that they were someone you cared about at one time.		My father has told us he doesn't see anything wrong with what he did because he "fell out of love" with our mom. I think if you can do that to someone you truly felt that you loved at one time, than maybe it wasn't love that you were feeling afterall. 
Already drunk by 7:30. 		Probably in bed by 9. 		Living the dream. That's just called being an adult. Gotta wake up early for work the next morning.

This gives me hope.I've been single and lost for a very, very long time, so much so that I got used to it.	It came to the point that I'm only interested in making friends with the opposite sex. If I'm nice to someone, it's because I want to.		I went to a nye party with one of my good friend, he ask me advices on how to talk to girls, I said: do like this, so I got up, scanned the dance floor and talked to the prettiest girl there, and ask her nicely if we could talk, tell her that my friend is really shy with girls and if it would be okay if I introduced her and maybe he can practice talking to a stranger. She was nice enough to oblige me and they talk for a bit. 		They talked for a good 20 minutes, they seemed to get along well so I let them be, be friend says he wasn't interested(I know hes just being too shy), so I keep introducing her to guys the week after, later on, she offers to give me a ride home, but as we got in her car, it didn't start. She got a towing to start the car and I offered to pay since they didn't take debit, she said she'd pay me back next time. (more on this later)		I was always myself and encouraged her to keep talking to guys and she'll meet someone because shes super awesome. She said she didn't need to look for anyone anymore (I didn't get it at the time) and gave me a ride home (it was only a few blocks) So when she dropped me off, I wished her good night and that It would be cool to hangout again.		She offered to take me out for lunch soon to pay me back.	So I said thanks and went home by myself (I was totally clueless that she wanted to get in) 	So 2 days later she messaged me to take me out (that soon?) and I offered to cook her supper instead since I like cooking.	We talked about music and life and people and it was so much fun.		Come might time I offered to have her sleep on the sofa or in my bed (and I'd sleep on the sofa) She said she wanted to be held because it had been a long time for her. So I held her all night but never made a move. 	It was really cool but I've cuddled with friends before and it's not a big deal. 		So a few days later she ask to hang out again, I said sure but thought it was weird to hang out twice on a weekday. 		So we repeat what we did the last time shes over, talked and talked for hours... And when we went to bed, she takes off her clothes and I go: Ohhhhhh!!! 	she looks at me and says: yeah. (as in, I've been hitting on you for a while now and you never got it)		So pretty much, I'm dating my friend now :D	I'm learning a lot with her, like how to love myself and come out of my shell a bit.	We've been unofficially dating for 2 weeks now and I feel like I found the flame I was looking for. It's amazing.		What I mean by my story (and thanks for reading btw) is: be yourself, be a friend first, if she likes you, she'll let you know. Worst case, you just made a good friend! Winwin!			Edit: English is my second language, I hope my phrase structures aren't so bad. 	I hope this story helps :D	Life is amazing. Keep being your awesome self. 	 			  
I sure hope so. Things feel awfully empty right now. Gotta have a little sadness once in a while, so you know when the good times come.

No one ever wants to DD that ride, so we made a rule that if anyone is inexperienced, we need a veteran aka someone that has done it over a dozen times.  And this very idea was the impetus for Wavy Gravy and the Hog Farmers at Woodstock. They had 'freak out' tents where those who were novices or were tripping out of control could be 'talked down'. And then, once they had regained their control, they would stay behind and help out with the next person.		This psychological approach was found to work quite well, as opposed to the medical staff there,who were more prone to just want to sedate the trippers with Thorazine, which bummed out the trip altogether.  	Most often one just needs a bit of talking down.	At least that's how it was way, way back in the day.

Don't care who you are, let's party!!It really just makes me all sorts of happy when younger people are aware that the older generations were once young, once vain, or shallow, or ignorant, but also carefree, inexperienced, students... just "young." And we remember how life felt when life was this endless landscape of vast opportunity and adventures not yet taken, when getting out or hooking up was our primary goal to have "fun", or the ease of getting enough of a group together to really enjoy a fun movie at home or play a board game or party game, and being able to stay over and get a little tipsy. Looking good, feeling good.		And what makes me even happier is the older generation here isn't cynical, or angry, or so tired of everything we all go through in our lives. Upon seeing these fun-having, young people, the first thought in her head isn't jealousy, it isn't eye-rolling, it isn't tutting them for dressing in sexy outfits, for taking selfies, for being loud.... the first thought in her head is, "I remember those times, those girls are going to have a great time, get in silly fights with their friends that feel like the end of the world, sleep with people they regret, anything can happen....and I hope those girls look back on tonight as fondly as I look back on all that nights of fun and hijinks.... that built the life I have lived."		This post is truly wholesome when you think of the 99.99% of other possible interactions in which this exact scenario could possibly end.		Great job OP! Thanks for sharing! I love you, have a hug!

Don't care who you are, let's party!!Probably going to be buried but want to share my relevant story. While I was studying in Spain we used to hang out after class in a nearby bar across the street that had one pool table. Helped kill time and we enjoyed a playful banter by making fun of each other skills (pretty decent players but nothing exceptional).		One day a very old guy comes and watches us play. And the etiquette is to place two quarters (the euro equivalent) to show you got the table for next game. So this dude places his coins and we were planning to take the game after his. When his turn came we learned that he was by himself and just wanted to join one of our teams. Obviously we agreed, but held back our teases as we didn't want to make him feel bad.		It didn't take long for us to figure out that he was great at this game and later learned he used to be a professional player when he was younger. He became part of our group consistently after that and also became the biggest troll when he was losing. 		Totally changed my perspective on how to interact with older people. Many can totally act like us as they were us once. Pepe, I hope you are still trolling the students at Bo Finn.

Don't care who you are, let's party!!This makes me so ridiculously happy...like, don't even have words. I hope when I'm older and feel like my partying days are over someone makes me feel like part of something, reminds me I'm more than just my age and the greys in my hair. And I hope the next time I'm out partying with my friends that an older person has the kindness to say something friendly and allows us to include them.

Don't care who you are, let's party!!Drunk girls in the restroom are the nicest people ever. On my 21st birthday I was waiting for a stall and group of 4 girls saw my birthday sash and got fucking psyched. They handed me a mini bottle of Fireball out of nowhere and cheered for me to chug it, wished me a happy birthday, and left. It was pretty rad.

Don't care who you are, let's party!!OLD PEOPLE BEING HAPPY MAKES ME CRY ON THE SPOT AAAAAHHHHH. Idk what it is man. It's just (in America) society seems to stop giving a shit about people once they hit a certain age, just ship them off to homes where they could easily experience elder abuse and also catch a ton of stds (no one talks to the elderly about using protection ) and then some never even get visits and it breaks my heart. They have to deal with so much physically, emotionally, and mentally so seeing people going out of their way to be kind makes me overwhelmed with emotion. This sub makes me cry so much ahaha the elderly deserve to party and have fun just as much as the rest of us (if not more)

Don't care who you are, let's party!!Okay this place is so adorable! Whoever is out there reading this, I wish y'all the best. 
Don't care who you are, let's party!!"I remember when my friends and I would get dressed up for a night on the town. We'd do our hair, wear low-cut shirts, show our ankles. Betty Sue was the real pretty one, so she was on boy patrol. She'd real them in, let them fawn over her and buy her drinks...Now, we always stayed near to Betty Sue while she was fishing, because it was our job to sneak up when the boy was lost in her eyes and to spike his drink. Within an hour he was slurring and stumbling like a regular ole tippler. So we'd lead him to Laura's house, she had her own place. Take him upstairs, push him back on the bed, tie his limbs to the posts. Then Mary Anne, she'd pull out this long, crooked, ceremonial dagger made of pure obsidian. She'd plunge it into the boy's chest and she'd draw it all the way down to his navel. One of us would stuff and hold socks in his mouth, to mute any screaming. When Mary was done, we'd each reach in and grab an organ, and we'd take those to her backyard, nice and secluded, where we burnt the organs as offerings to Satan. Afterwards, with blood on our hands, we'd start taking off each others clothes, touching and kissing each other all over like school girls do. I miss those days...So, do you girls like to party or what?"

It really just makes me all sorts of happy when younger people are aware that the older generations were once young, once vain, or shallow, or ignorant, but also carefree, inexperienced, students... just "young." And we remember how life felt when life was this endless landscape of vast opportunity and adventures not yet taken, when getting out or hooking up was our primary goal to have "fun", or the ease of getting enough of a group together to really enjoy a fun movie at home or play a board game or party game, and being able to stay over and get a little tipsy. Looking good, feeling good.		And what makes me even happier is the older generation here isn't cynical, or angry, or so tired of everything we all go through in our lives. Upon seeing these fun-having, young people, the first thought in her head isn't jealousy, it isn't eye-rolling, it isn't tutting them for dressing in sexy outfits, for taking selfies, for being loud.... the first thought in her head is, "I remember those times, those girls are going to have a great time, get in silly fights with their friends that feel like the end of the world, sleep with people they regret, anything can happen....and I hope those girls look back on tonight as fondly as I look back on all that nights of fun and hijinks.... that built the life I have lived."

Probably going to be buried but want to share my relevant story. While I was studying in Spain we used to hang out after class in a nearby bar across the street that had one pool table. Helped kill time and we enjoyed a playful banter by making fun of each other skills (pretty decent players but nothing exceptional).		One day a very old guy comes and watches us play. And the etiquette is to place two quarters (the euro equivalent) to show you got the table for next game. So this dude places his coins and we were planning to take the game after his. When his turn came we learned that he was by himself and just wanted to join one of our teams. Obviously we agreed, but held back our teases as we didn't want to make him feel bad.		It didn't take long for us to figure out that he was great at this game and later learned he used to be a professional player when he was younger. He became part of our group consistently after that and also became the biggest troll when he was losing. 		Totally changed my perspective on how to interact with older people. Many can totally act like us as they were us once. Pepe, I hope you are still trolling the students at Bo Finn.Unfortunately your story was buried by u/wholesomebot.

wew i'm missing out on that because of my mental health yee-hawWhat /u/whilelminTherapy describes is a really beautiful and positive way to view different periods of your life, but do not fall into the trap of thinking that your youth *will* be the best years of your life and it's downhill from there. You get to make a choice about where your life goes, and if you make good choices, your life can become richer as you get older. The longer you live, the more skills you can learn, the more places you can visit, the deeper the friendships you can develop, and the greater understanding of the world and its people you can gain. There's no age limit on valuable experiences.

Anyone who started in this decade and isn't actually paying attention to their drugs probably hasn't had real Molly.		I'd definitely try MDMA, but I don't think I'll even bother getting a testing kit because I'm so sure that where I am will not have any good shit.

While this might not be the subreddit to voice this, you can be "caught for cheating" without actually cheating. Some people have just been hurt too many times to trust someone even when they speak the truth.Yep, girlfriend got ditched at her own wedding and found out she was being cheated on since week 1 of a 5 year relationship. If I'm browsing my phone and smiling, or on the phone in the middle of the night, she comes to be bawling her eyes out or even worse goes into a full on panic attack. Simply smiling at some wholesome memes or talking to my cousin on the other side of the world can just trigger her mind to race a million miles an hour but all I can do is comfort her, explain the situation and take care of her. Be it through the day or when she's having a bad dream at 4 am, all I can do is console her and love her through these unfortunate moments, I don't think she will ever get through such a traumatic experience unfortunately. 
While this might not be the subreddit to voice this, you can be "caught for cheating" without actually cheating.

Yep, girlfriend got ditched at her own wedding and found out she was being cheated on since week 1 of a 5 year relationship. If I'm browsing my phone and smiling, or on the phone in the middle of the night, she comes to be bawling her eyes out or even worse goes into a full on panic attack. Simply smiling at some wholesome memes or talking to my cousin on the other side of the world can just trigger her mind to race a million miles an hour but all I can do is comfort her, explain the situation and take care of her. Be it through the day or when she's having a bad dream at 4 am, all I can do is console her and love her through these unfortunate moments, I don't think she will ever get through such a traumatic experience unfortunately. That's so awesome of you to be a solid shoulder to cry on.

This is an extremely wholesome comment. This sub is great Yeah, a bit TOO wholesome. You know, quiet village in the woods wholesome. And then it turns out all the folk in there are happy little cannibals.
Exactly my point about this post. I don't know what you said in your [removed] comment, but let me tell you what this meme means to me.		Don't feel you need to lie to people to impress them.		Don't make up a narrative about yourself that is full of exaggerations or lies to feel like the kind of person people would like.		Don't fake your resume and don't promise people something you can't deliver.		*Because a person with integrity doesn't lie to manipulate people.*		We're all vulnerable to temptation to tell lies or self-aggrandize but honestly the coolest people are the one's that are just comfortable with themselves and make other people comfortable.		As it relates to "cheating on your girl", life gets too complicated when you start telling lies that need to become your reality to get away with bigger lies. It takes a lot of work to keep up that kind of charade, and you are always one slip-up away from your whole house of cards collapsing.		The simplest backstory is the one that's true. If you accept your own reality, it's absolutely the best one for you to maintain a wholesome sense of integrity. People love that. The pleasure you get from connecting with others in an honest way is the best sense of personal freedom you can have.		To me the meme is suggesting that the best way to avoid drama in your life is to stop infecting your own life with drama because you think it somehow makes your life more interesting. 		Don't unnecessarily make your own life more difficult. 		This meme is a valuable, and wholesome, life lesson.
I'm sorry you feel unhappy with you job, friend. I hope you move on to bigger and better things! Forgot how nice of a sub this is. Great refresher from the rest of Reddit.

I was going to put something together with OP's mum and your broken arms but instead I'd like to point out that doing your work is the best way to go. In working life, you have to do a LOT of pointless work whether you like it or not. Its good to get used to it as it is less painful later. Developing work ethic, in general, is great as it helps cope with the endless grind. This isn't to say working life is all pain and crap BUT it has its moments. The more prepared you are, the better.I barely ever hear any work-ethic pep-talks like this in my daily life. Too much "enjoy what you do". But sometimes you won't enjoy it and that's okay too. Saved your comment and will refer back to it in the future and  will now go back to studying. 
It will happen for you :-) 		There's lots out there I don't know if it's in my cards, but I refuse to close my heart. That would be defeating the purpose of love :-) x

If it helps the funniest Monte Python bits for me are "The Ministry of Silly Walks" and "The Funniest Joke in the World" I honestly think that Monty Python has to be watched as a whole, rather than individual sketches. I mean, of course the individual sketches can be funny, but a lot of the surreal humor that makes them so famous comes from their show as a whole. Quite often they would make their show appear to finish early, In one episode they ran the end credits after literally one sketch. Other times they would play nearly the entire show as a single long sketch, then run the opening credits near the very end. Quite often they would do links in the style of the BBC at the time. There's a fantastic sketch about how the BBC announcer is 'having trouble at home' and can't announce very well, and has another announcer and then *his wife* come in and help him through it, and then congratulate him... as the actual BBC Newscaster appeared on the television to read the 'headlines' silently.		Monty Python requires a lot of context to properly appreciate, especially so many years after all the pop cultural references and groundbreaking humour have ceased to be pop culture and groundbreaking, respectively. It's a similar problem that plagued Seinfeld; it's become so common now that most of the things that they *invented* seem well, cliche to those who have grown up experiencing it all from a dozen different sources.		**Edit:** Reading this, I realise how pretentious it sounds. I wasn't trying to say "You just don't understand it \*sniff*," more just if you only watch the most famous sketches, it's hard to get a true picture of what Monty Python was and why they were so important to the evolution of TV comedy.
Aaaand there it is...whoop, there it is
swing it at shitOccam's Razor right here. Simplest solution is usually the best.
whoop, there it is>Whoop, there it is 		Whoomp, there it is		FTFY	
I appreciate your input on the subject. I agree that the cultural context of the show probably makes all the difference, that said I still believe Monte Python just isn't really for me. I mean, Holy Grail and Life of Brian are pretty good. And pretty much everything Terry Gilliam made after Python is great.Definitely. The movies were what you got when the Pythons put their heads together and actually worked towards a coherent whole. From what I've gathered in interviews, much of the show's sketches were split between the six of them in two-man teams, hence the wildly differing tones from one sketch to the next.		if you like the movies, may I suggest a few of the longer sketches:		Science Fiction Sketch.		Mister Neutron (which was a whole-episode sketch)		The Cycling Tour (another full episode)		and just because it's one of my absolute favourites, and an actual satire of a contemporary film maker: Sam Peckinpah's *Salad Days*
Chaotic Good BoyMy next door neighbors are a very sweet retired couple and foster dogs.

He couldn't pass the portion of his test where he had treats out but had to ignore them and follow the commands. Stevie is sweet as a damn pie and God knows that dog is itching to help you all day long, but that boy will drop your shit in a second for a cheese cube.		Edit: a loose cannon apostrophe, yikes!
Chaotic Good BoyI've only just opened reddit but this post is going to make me laugh all day, I can tell. Fuckin dogs, man. They're so ridiculous in all the best ways.
Chaotic Good Boymy sister uses a wheelchair so they tried to train a dog to help her, but he would just steal the socks off her feet whenever he wanted haha he was still a good pet tho
Chaotic Good BoyMaybe she needs to get a couple more gym badges and then the dog will listen.
Chaotic Good BoyI've got a friend who's got a service dog.  He is the *best* dog.  He gets to be a 'normal dog' whenever his guy is just holding the leash and not the harness and man does he make the most of it.  Nuzzling everyone hello and lolling around on the ground waiting to be petted and just loving life.  Then back to work keeping his human safe!  
Chaotic Good BoyOh you silly doggo
Chaotic Good BoyMy lab learned to open doors so I trained her to knock and if nobody answers shes not allowed to come in. Fixed the problem for the most part, unless someone unknown comes knocking, she opens the front door and barks at the entrance and scares the shit out of mailman or whoever is paying a visit.
Chaotic Good BoyOh man, my service dog started his 'career' as a mobility support/special skills dog. He does the same sort of things- turns on and off lights, takes clothes out of the dyer into a laundry basket, getting pants out or a shirt out of different shelves, open and closes doors, helps with mobility, etc. 		He's wonderful 99% of the time, very serious all the time, hard working but he can occasionally hold a grudge- same way a a guide dog occasionally gets annoyed and runs their handler into a doorway. Then it's chaos! Dishes taken out of the dishwasher and left wherever instead of on the counter, every light turned on, laundry strewn about. I can guilt him into cleaning it up after his temper tantrum but he gets his point across. Usually it happens if I accidentally run over his paw with my grocery cart out shopping. He wont be pissy with his working harness on out in public but soon as we get home and he gets his working gear taken off then the temper tantrum starts. 
Chaotic Good BoyThat lady's neighbors must have thought she lived in a haunted house. "The lights turn on and off, over and over, at completely random times. The door will just open up by itself. I've seen it. Her dog was there, inside, but she wasn't home. Crazy." Edit: the dog forgot a word. So bad at taking dictation.
Chaotic Good BoyWhat would a chaotic evil doggo be like?
Chaotic Good BoyI had a dog who would listen to every word I said, but good luck to my older siblings and parents. He would also escape the ski house, run onto the slopes, and take gloves off skiers WHO WERE STILL BOOKING IT DOWN A BLACK DIAMOND. He knew not to eat our gloves.
Chaotic Good BoyHahaha.  I keep seeing this sub in /r/all and it makes me happy, especially contrasted with all the political hullabaloo, so I subbed :)
Chaotic Good BoyMy doggo is a failed police dog. He was supposed to attack the criminals. But he would bite them over and over again instead of holding on. 		He's a super good boy and loves people and dogs but he's a very loyal and protective breed so he looks scary at the door. But he's really a big idiot who likes having his paws held. 
Chaotic Good BoyImagine if there was a Baldur's Gate/Neverwinter Nights style RPG but everything was puppers. That would be great. (Insert fetch quest joke here)
Chaotic Good BoyWe had one of these. She was an Irish Wolfhound mix who was almost 3 feet tall at the shoulder.Shean would go through drawers, leave the fridge open and got out of the yard all the time. She was a very sweet dog. When my daughter went to school she would sneak into her bedroom and steal one of the dolls always the same doll, off the bed and lay down with it on her bed in the living room. Then, before my daughter got home from school she would take the doll and put it back where she got it.
Chaotic Good BoyAre failed service dogs common? 
Chaotic Good BoyD'awwwh

Chaotic Good BoyHey OP, great post! One small suggestion for next time, if you don't put the punchline in the title that gives us the chance to experience it for ourselves!

He's a giant calm doof, he just didn't have the focus to lead a blind person.

He has us pet sit them when he's out of town and the dogs are amazing  -- best mannered pets ever.  It's just like that Simpsons episode where they get Laddie.		He lets them run around outside without a leash sometimes (which he's not allowed to do) and one time the dog ran to the next street over, and someone picked it up and called the number on the tag (the org that owns the dog).		He got in big trouble with the seeing eye dog organization and they threatened to have him never foster again.   		He was telling me the story about getting in trouble and he said, '**they're just upset because these are $30,000 dogs**'.  I was blown away by that.

Are failed service dogs common? yes, but they always get adopted since they are popular breeds and well trained.
Are failed service dogs common? I raised a Seeing Eye puppy. They look for volunteers to raise their puppies from 2-12 months old. It seemed like the failure rate is very high. There was one foster family in the program who was on their fourth puppy, and all of the previous three had failed. Mine did too! The bar is very high for any dog that will be responsible for the safety of a human.		The foster parents get first dibs though. So of course we kept ours. She came back from her training with excellent manners, but the Seeing Eye didn't share with us what they had taught her. If she learned any specialized service dog skills, we'll never know... She didn't do anything out of the ordinary. She was a great dog though.

To be fair id much rather a doggo with a mind of his own than a service dog that does exactly as theyre told		A little chaos is expected from all my animalsI agree with you, then I would realize the error in my ways when I come home to see my freezer has been open for 8 hours and the doggo is just sitting there.
the fact that he's acting selfishly means it'd be evil.  I'm kind of torn on the chaotic or lawful aspect, since he adhered to the orders given down to him to learn the skills, yet is currently disobeying his masters in order to do as he wishes...		So probably neutral evil would be a more accurate description, imo.Eh, evil requires maliciousness, good requires altruism. I'd say chaotic or true neutral. Doing what he wants, when he wants, without consideration of "the rules" would seem to indicate chaotic.		That said, all puppers are good, so chaotic good it is!
I knew a dog like this! My teacher was doing the pre-service training with him the first year and basically everyone knew he'd fail. Way too food motivated. So a bunch of families went on the waitlist for him, and one got him and ended up making him a therapy dog for kids with special needs, which was the perfect job for him.  	He's a giant calm doof, he just didn't have the focus to lead a blind person.This was what our failed seeing eye dog did! He was calm and sweet and friendly but every time he saw a squirrel he flipped shit which is simply not ideal for a blind person being led by a hundred pound newfoundland.	Now he's a "companion animal" for a teenage boy with autism and just gets to romp around and receive endless belly rubs

That reminds me of the dog that decided to eat everything he could while he was competing in a dog show.  [Hungry pupper](https://youtu.be/5iTTNRE-njM?t=25s)Yes! Ha ha ha, but seriously. There was a giant hot dog just sitting on the ground. It was a dream come true!

My uncle has a former seeing eye dog that passed all the tests and even was assigned to a blind person, but he just kept eating socks. It's a silly dog.Haha, maybe he got my friend's seeing eye dog. He almost failed out, made it through the school just barely. You could tell, too - most guide dogs are calm and obedient, but this guy, you could tell he wanted to make you happy, but he wanted to make himself happy too. Was assigned to my friend and ate her socks whenever he had the chance. She loved the heck out of him. He retired a few years ago and lives with a family that adopts retired seeing eye dogs. 
My male dog gets upset when he can't find someone so he'll go knock on every door with his head until he finds one that opens, checks the person inside the room and then goes off to sleep.		I love him.Aww, that's so cute. One of my cats was a bit dim so she did a similar thing...by yowling at max volume in the living room at 3AM. >__> but we loved her anyway lol
Lol both of my sister's dogs failed out of programs, since her husband has an uncle who fosters them.  The dogs are insane.  I had a buddy help me do additional training with the husky and he is now a menace dog.  Somehow he managed to open a childproof cabinet, pull out the dog treats and the cookies.  I walked in to find him face deep in treats and my niece covered in Oreo.  >I walked in to find him face deep in treats and my niece covered in Oreo.

How did you teach the dog to knock?! And how does he do aforementioned knocking?Every time when she opened a door without permission I told her bad dog, the knocking came naturally after that. She bumps her head to the door and waits, if you don't open the door she starts bumping it even more and if you don't open she gives up. 
WHAT? I would like to subscribe to your newsletter- this was insane to read.  This is[ Schalke](http://i.imgur.com/3gaBU3r.jpg)! And here [he is with his sister.](http://i.imgur.com/Ck2tkOe.jpg)		I've had him as my service dog for 6 1/2 years now and he's literally saved my life twice. He even went through a bad roll over car accident with my husband and I, travelling in the ambulance with me to the emergency room(he is registered as "do not separate from handler" type of service dog with that kind of numbered badge and people are very good about respecting that) before being taken by my father in law to be treated at a nearby vet. 		He's an amazing dog. Not much for fun at all, and he's always on the look out for anyone who might fall down and need help. His one time he relaxes is he loves to retrieve orange hockey balls- though even that is serious business.		He's amazing, but yeah he can have a real attitude sometimes. Especially if he decides something is dangerous and I try and convince him it's not. His mission is to not let me get hurt and he's always on the job whether I want him to be or not! Oh and he's never been wrong when he alerts a seizure is coming. I sometimes think "I feel fine no way I'm going to seize" but he's never been wrong. He tells me and I sit on the floor or lay on my bed and get into a safe position- then he lays across me to prevent me trying to get up and falling. Especially post seizure when I was trying to get up and falling not realising I was out of it. 		Good ol' Schalke. He loves his marro-bones treats and he earns them.

Aww, that's so cute.

I get wicked cranky when my sleep is disturbed, so I started putting him in the basement with the door closed whenever he made noise at night.   		 It didn't take him long to learn that if he runs around and yowls when we're sleeping, he loses the ability to look out the windows, and can't come sleep with his people when he gets bored with that.  Now he spends most nights curled up next to my face, and if he needs to go prowl, he's quiet and sneaky about it.

How can someone get a failed service dog? Is there a club or a website? Well for my club they first get offered to the raisers. If the raisers don't want to keep the dog then the raiser gets the right to offer the dog to a friend or family member. If they don't have anyone interested then they adopt them out of our local campus.		I don't want to say which club specifically that I'm in but just google "seeing eye dog's California" and you'll see a couple.

I love hearing your stories about Schalke! Please tell more! What breed is he?He's a Springer Spaniel x [L'Epagneul Francais](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89pagneul_fran%C3%A7ais). So one spaniel, assorted. 		[Here he is a puppy stuck in a table.](http://i.imgur.com/347Fzic.jpg) 		I do love talking about him. He's amazing because he's my safety net, after brain damage I went from wheel chair to walker to using him as mobility support and can walk now. We even trained for a 5 km race after I had been through rehab. I have serious problems again but he's still my walking support and keeping me from having to use a wheelchair except rarely. That's what that heavy duty harness he wears is for- support. Though he has a mixed guide + mobility harness system because I lost vision after that brain damage and have continued losing vision since. 			He went through a very bad accident when he was younger- his foot was caught in a foot trap set at a local offleash hiking trail. When the snares and foot traps were set the municipality was supposed to put up warnings for people to keep dogs out for the duration of catching the coyote but, well, they didn't(sadly, someone's border collie was snared). I threw him the ball during his off duty walk and he went to retrieve it and that's when his foot was partially severed. If you can picture a leg hold trap snapping shut he managed to yank his foot almost free, just the bottom was cut. So he came limping back and blood was everywhere. My father had to carry him to his SUV gushing blood and drive him to the vet as an emergency. We had two his toes that were re-attached, he had to have skin grafts on the bottom pad, and he lost two ligaments that couldn't be found up inside his leg where they were cut through. It was months and months and months of vet visits every two days for bandage changes and  treatment. It was terrifying because with a limp he could stay working but if the foot was amputated he was required to retire. For three months it looked like he was going to loose the leg- I was heart broken. The waiting list for special skills dogs is very, very long and they have to be trained specifically for you and your own disabilities. I admit that I was also attached to the idiot- he saved my life when I blacked out and fell into an icy ditch at -17 weather! It was night and no one would have found me before I went into hypothermia if he had not run back to the nearest houses then back to me and back to houses and back to me until someone finally followed him and called 911. We had bonded intensely- but I can't take care of a dog who was not my service dog. I couldn't have kept him and a new service dog. I need a service dog. I have 0 independence without one. It's embarrassing but I can't even go to the bathroom alone without his help to sit and stand off the toilet.		Luckily by month 4 we started seeing him healing up, he also perked up emotionally. By the end of six months we knew his leg was safe! BUT he has what I call his "goofy toes"- these are the two severed and reattached toes that have no ligament and missing some bone and cannot move. They just kinda flop there being silly on his paw. 		He does have a limp, but you can't always see it. 		The most amazing thing of all is that remember how I said he took his ball retrieving seriously? When he was injured he **STILL BROUGHT BACK THE BALL**! With part of his foot cut off by a leg hold trap! He tried to run back and stumbled and tried again, stumbled again, then literally elbow crawled his way back, leaving a rivulet of blood, and delivered the ball to my tennis racquet! (I can't bend down to pick up a ball and can't see well to catch it or move my arms well to throw it so I use an over sized tennis racquet. I hold it out flat and he returns the ball by running back to me and placing the ball on the flat racquet face. When I hear and feel it hit the racquet I know I have it back and can 'toss' it for him again).		It's part of who he is. He finishes the job no matter what! 	[Here is his during a his healing stage with a splint and bandage.](http://i.imgur.com/gQHUf6G.jpg)			--	 	One time when someone ran a red light while we were crossing he pulled me back out of danger. He's been taught a lot of rules about dealing with cars- he will not let me pass behind a car with it's back up lights on, and he literally looks right and left before crossing a street. In this case he was listening for the crossing beep at the zebra crossing but someone ran the red light! He saw it coming and forced me back into safety even though it meant he got knicked by the car and knocked off his feet and backwards. He was fine except for a bruised shoulder where he was pushed into the curb when he fell, but it was a hard enough hit to yank his harness out my of hand! He got up and first thing he did was his 'leash' command, which is positioning himself so the handle touches my fingers/palm and I can find him even when I have no vision. (if on a regular leash he picks the leash up in his mouth and pushes that against my hand). People stopped to check on us and call for help and he got checked out to be sure no broken leg since he was favoring the shoulder.		He got be on the news and was on a poster about furry heroes on an online service dog awareness week a website did, which was awesome! 		Oh but he has some bad things about him- he hates children. HATES them. He'll brace them if they start to fall off their bike but otherwise he finds they run and fall too much for his liking and he'll bark to if they are being unsafe near him. When working(in his harness) if they try and touch him he just freezes and cringes, or moves away from the touch. Off duty he will avoid children anyway he can. He also doesn't understand how to speak dog very well. Special Skills dogs have intense training and they start young. He missed a lot of early socialisation and they're recommended just as handler you keep them away from other dogs on walks or playing. He didn't know how to play any dog games really, like tug of war until I moved in with my fiance who got a little yellow Lab puppy. She taught him a lot about how to be a dog. He discovered how to play and I honestly think it was good for him to learn how to be a little bit less obsessively focus on me.		He's not fond of other dogs, not nasty but not really nice. He does seem to have genuinely warmed up to his sister, though.		And he has the worst farts in the universe. Like the spawn of Nurgle live in his ass. It makes my eyes water. Lab has normal smelly dog farts and they are awful but Schalke's butt is like a portal into another very, very gross stinky dimension. It's a black hole of ultra dense uber stank destroying all around it.

His calves will be swole afInteresting thing is... They probably wont be. For ultraendurance cycling events, it's near impossible to get the right nutrition from usually gas stations alone, so they body starts eating into muscle for protein and energy... Usually end up weaker at the end of cycling 150-300mi every day for many days. 		There are two great documentaries of self-supported ultra cycling races on Netflix if anyone is interested:		*Inspired to Ride* covers the Trans Am Bike Race, a 4233mi race across the US. Winner did 250 miles a day. 		*Ride the Divide* covers the Tour Divide, a 2700mi mountain bike race from Alberta to Mexico over the Rockies. 		Both are really fun to watch :)

The fuck does this actually mean? What is a "dog year"?

Witch you could reinterpret as dogs aging 70% faster than a human, witch means that they age 7 years for every normal year.

This database was an important tool for the public to keep an eye on facilities that serially and egregiously violated the Animal Welfare Act. It was also an important way to make sure the USDA was doing a good job.		The USDA said it shut down the database out of privacy concerns. However, the records it uploaded to the database did not contain sensitive information. Additionally, USDA was already redacting certain information (e.g. the name of its inspectors) before uploading to the database. Why couldn't it do the same for whatever other sensitive information appeared on the document?		The result of this action will be to obscure what is really going on at puppy mills, laboratories, and zoos around the country. It will take months or even years for the public to access this data under normal FOIA requests. The USDA's decision benefits nobody except for corporations that want to keep their animal abuse hidden from the public.	I ask your office to please immediately find out why the USDA shut this important database, and to do everything possible to bring the database back online.

I look forward to day that everyone is accepted for their sexual orientation.		And when coming out is no longer considered brave, but something that's accepted and celebrated but it's no big deal.		Hopefully one day. The thing is that right now - and a lot of people still don't seem to understand that this is actually the case - it *is* pretty brave to come out. I recently came out as trans, and I don't think I'll ever be able to describe just how impossible it was to do on so many levels - getting over the internalised hatred I had for myself, forcing myself to actually confront something I'd repressed for so many years of my life, and then trying to put that feeling and the feelings I had constantly - which I myself was often confused and scared by - into words, directed at people who I had no guarantee would react remotely positively.		I've had 3 simultaneous large kidney stones, I've lost a huge number of people close to me in my life, but I still consider coming out as the hardest thing I'll probably ever have to go through, despite all the numerous advantages I have over people in worse situations. It makes me kind of upset when I see people trying to downplay how hard coming out is or how people would somehow just do it for attention, because it feels like they're trying to minimise the amount of pain that I and people like me have gone through.		Definitely, hopefully one day that'll be the case though. It just seems like an awfully long way away at the moment.

Hopefully one day. Maybe a weird opinion but as someone who grew up with a lesbian aunt i always thought that it's just as weird to put it on a pedestal by celebrating it...i mean when a kid/teen "comes out" by having any kind of romantic interest the usual reaction is just along the lines of "meh..." "ok then..." "that's nice" or a bunch of ribbing about teenage drama. 		Treating the actual comming outs in a way more positively/suportively we're again making the distinction that a coming out is different to starting to show an interest in romance at all which in an ideal world it is not.

YesThank you for the confirmation.
I look forward to the day when no one has to come out all. You can just be. Nothing more accepting than people showing they don't really give a shit. I'd rather have people treat it like it's nothing rather than make it like I've been crowned the new world ruler
I look forward to the day when no one has to come out all. You can just be. Honestly, I don't know if this will ever happen. I feel like one day differing sexual orientations won't be stigmatized, but the relative rarity will always come across as novel. People with blue eyes, redheads, double-jointed people, etc..... they can "just be" too, but there's still a reaction because it's uncommon. Coming across one of 4% of the population is never going to be as unremarkable as coming across somebody with a nose and a mouth.

Treating the actual comming outs in a way more positively/suportively we're again making the distinction that a coming out is different to starting to show an interest in romance at all which in an ideal world it is not. Think of it this way: Some kids come out of the closet and immediately became homeless.		I don't meant that hyperbolically, I mean that literally. "I'm gay" are two words between safety and the streets. Two word are between security and physical violence. Just two words. "I'm gay" and you are beaten. "I'm gay" and you have no more family. "I'm gay" and you are shunned.		So when the act is celebrated, it's a way to tell people that "we accept you no matter what" and takes the fear of being ones self away from people still in the closet.		Thankfully, I did not have to grow up with this fear, but many people I know did. One friend was kicked out of his house, his school, and his *town*. Again, no hyperbole. At 16, he was on his own, because he thought his parents would love him no matter what. "I'm gay" proved that this was false.

When you're growing up and start to realize who, and what, you are it becomes scary. That scary time is different for a lot of people. You never know how people will react, sure you can kind of gauge it based on stuff they say when they think you're straight, but you still aren't sure at a younger age. I remember being 18-19 and slowly coming out to my friends and family. It was terrifying each time. Luckily I had an amazing family and group of friends, but that isn't always the case. Tons of people express who they are and are banished from their homes, beaten, cast out of friend groups, or even turn to suicide. One thing about being gay is that you're constantly having to come out (unless you're suuuuper gay, like beyond normal gayness and pushing into a stereotype). Every time you start a new job, meet a newly hired coworker, or interact with new people you will see more than once, you have to keep constantly coming out. If you live in a big city then you're usually good, but in more rural areas maybe not. It does get easier as you get older though.

Gay kids have to endure the "do you have an oppositesexfriend yet?" before they figured out what's what. Gay kids get sent to conversion camps because their parents think it's an illness. Gay kids get bullied until they kill themselves every day. Gay kids have to hide and put away their sexuality and as a result have hard times forming good relationships later in life. Gay kids have to defy what's *expected* of them even in pro-lgbt situations. Yes, in a perfect world 'coming out' wouldn't be a thing at all, but until we've reached that point please, please let's celebrate the brave kids. The kids that are not afraid to stand up and show their true selves. Show them with all we've got that we support them, that they're worthy and that they should never feel like they don't belong. Because despite what a lot of us would like the situation to be, kids still need courage to say those two words, I'm gay, even when it's just to themselves in the mirror. And by showing your love and support for the kids that are so brave to come out, you'll reach the ones that have yet to take that step extra super hard.

That fact that it's so accepted actually makes it a little harder for me. For my parents, I was able to build it up by saying "Hey, I have to tell you something." For my friends, any sort of preamble to it may seem like a bit overdramatic. Our generation is a lot more accepting. I remember when one of my close friends told me they were gay. I had known for years.  It was like I know, and I love you like my brother. Then we went back to playing video games. The people who love you will love regardless of who you love. 		Props for having the strength to be open with your friends and family.
I don't think it should be celebrated, that's still dimmening. Just be gay. Sexuality aside, I think anyone figuring out who they are and being able to proclaim it should be celebrated.

Nothing more accepting than people showing they don't really give a shit. I'd rather have people treat it like it's nothing rather than make it like I've been crowned the new world rulerSome gay people come from toxic environments where if they had these feelings and expressed them would be disowned/ostracized maybe even physically harmed. Many LGBT+ people had to keep this feelings deep inside them and always lived in fear of people finding out. So coming out can be hard for them and is really emotional. Plus it helps other people going through similar things know they aren't alone and it can get better. 
Nothing more accepting than people showing they don't really give a shit. I'd rather have people treat it like it's nothing rather than make it like I've been crowned the new world rulerI act the same way. Everyone js themselves, they shouldn't be ashamed of who they like.

However, celebration is nice while we still have some adversity.

It really upsets me to see a lot of people on this supposedly wholesome subreddit forcing their world view on others who have different life experiences. Like just because some people can come out as gay without serious repercussions, doesn't mean that its even remotely that easy for others. My brother didn't come out until he was out of high school, even though we all basically knew (via porn, incidentally) and my family was generally accepting of it. But he was bullied a lot in school and on social media so its understandable.
I hope one day it's just as someone who prefers a motorcycle.bike-curious?

It sickens me that there are still people who exist who act like this.And until those people don't exist, we're going to keep up with our gay pride parades. Being gay should be as irrelevant as what kind of ice cream you like the most (chocolate mint is obviously the best but the other flavors are also the best!) or what color your eyes are.
You're really underestimating gay people. Not one of my gay friends has ever felt like they have to 'endure' anything. People assume you're straight because 95% of people are - it's not personal. Then you just tell them you're gay and that's that. This hysteria over gays is only making the problem worse. You can point to ANY group of people who are in the minority and claim they have such hard lives. But you know what? They don't. Because it's just one aspect of who they are and if someone is going to judge you as a whole based on just one attribute, you shouldn't listen to them anyway.  Yeah, that only really works if all that happens when you come out is that people might say some mean words to you. That's super if that's how it is for you, or for me, but it doesn't mean that applies everywhere for everyone. 		Sometimes it's really shitty and people have genuinely crappy consequences to coming out. It's lovely and great that your friends haven't had to endure anything - and I'm super glad that things are improving that much - but your/their experience doesn't reflect everyone's.

Bob Ross <3I remember when twitch started the Bob Ross marathon I had a fever and was going through a couple of pretty bad days, but watching the streams and hearing his sweet words really helped me through.
Bob Ross <3My little sister and I threw a paint party for my mom's "Sweet 16" this year (okay, her actual age was a little different than that, but it did have a 1 and a 6). Between my mom and my sisters we live in 4 states and two time zones, so it was really great to be able to get everyone together. Plus, my mom is fantastic at oil painting. 
Bob Ross <3So I met this girl who's favorite artists was Bob Ross, and I took her out on a date. She was telling me about how she really wants to meet him... and I just sat there silent .. I had to be the guy to break the news to her, and I felt really bad because she almost started crying.

Any recommendation as to an episode and list of brushes/paints needed? It looks like you guys nailed it.I recently started painting with Bob, so I can give you some ideas since OP said he just found this picture and isn't in it...		supplies you absolutely need: 	at least one 2 inch brush	at least one fan brush	painting knife	paint thinner (for cleaning)	various oil paints, but also make sure you either purchase liquid white, or google how to make it. 		my suggestions are thus:		First, find an episode you want to do, and get specifically the paints for that episode (he lists them in the beginning of every episode). There is an hour long, beginner special that he does that's pretty good... but just find a painting you like! And as far as the paints, if you buy a huge pack and don't like it, you'll be upset... And we don't want that.		Second, do it somewhere that it's ok if things get a little dirty. Since they're oil based, the paints are VERY difficult to get out. Same goes for clothing... wear some old stuff you don't really care about.		Third... have fun!

There's that story about a colorblind man who wrote to him about how he couldn't paint.  That bothered Bob, so he did a painting in a single shade of colors so this one guy could paint along too.		He really loved animals too. Cared for squirrels and all sorts of little critters.  Hell, his descriptions of Alaska made me want to visit.

If you're on a budget, you could buy knockoff-brands for $50 or so.   		Always have backup paint available or distribute the paint yourself. Never trust others with the containers/tubes.

If it's not to much hassle I'd love to know the actual details.

Kasturba Gandhi had been imprisoned, was 75 years old and bedridden after 2 heart attacks. The authorities approved her request for a traditional Ayurvedic doctor only after a delay (Gandhi felt this delay unconscionable). (Ayurveda is recognized, taught and used commonly even today in India and would have been the medicine system most familiar to the Gandhis. Ayu=life and Veda =science/knowledge).		Her recovery was slow, but enough for her to get to the verandah (balcony/porch) when she suffered a relapse with bronchial pneumonia and complications such as kidney failure. It was serious enough for the British to release Gandhi from his prison to her bedside. She had grown resigned/fatalistic and assured others that she would not make it, asking them to 'let her go'. Gandhi too became reconciled to her death and gave her up to God.	At this juncture, their son Devdas reached there and asked to administer penicillin. Penicillin was then a newish miracle drug, rare in wartime India, but Devdas had been able to arrange for a supply to be flown in from Calcutta to Poona. By then the doctors there too had given her up for dead (in fact she had already been given the sacrament of water from the holy ganga). After learning his suffering wife would have to be woken every four hours for an injection, Gandhi objected, feeling nothing could save her and that it would just prolong her agony. His last word on it was "still if you insist, I will not stand in your way". Devdas gave way. Kasturba died mere hours later that night in the lap of her husband of 61 years.		I believe grace sometimes lies in accepting the suffering/death of loved ones and not in fighting to their last breath.	Gandhi accepting quinine some time later is a completely different situation. The extract from the bark of the cinchona tree had been long known to treat malaria and had been used in tonic water by British troops in India as early as the 1820s to ward off malaria.	TLDR; Gandhi objected to, but did not veto, a proposal to administer penicillin (a newish and rare miracle drug) to his terminally ill 75 year old wife (dying after 2 heart attacks, bronchial pneumonia, kidney failure and complications) mere hours before she died because he felt that it would not make any difference except increase her suffering. They were both reconciled to her death.			
The fidelity issues were FBI propagandaThat's pretty disingenuous to say, because it implies the allegations of King's infidelities were made up by the FBI. They weren't; he did cheat on his wife, and while the FBI definitely used this information to discredit him, that doesn't mean he never stepped outside his marriage.		>[FBI directorJ. Edgar Hooverordered the bugging on his own authority; looking for ties to Communists, he stumbled upon King's extramarital activities, and one of his deputies, in an effort to discredit King, then sent the tapes to King's office.]( http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/selma-sex-tape-controversy-mlk-774974)	>	>[Garrow] quotes one King staffer who said, "Had the man lived, the marriage wouldn't have survived  and everybody feels that way," and another staffer who said, "Coretta King was most certainly a widow long before Dr. King died." King avoided his understandably angry wife and bedded many women instead. "Only one [of King's girlfriends] was significant, and she's still alive," says Garrow. 		As I said above, his extramarital affairs in no way outweigh all the amazing things he accomplished during the civil rights movement, but let's not rewrite history here.

I was always told he rejected the medicine straight up. Never that it was more of a last resort option that he was opposed to. 			I absolutely agree with your statement on death. Our family went through that same thing as my grandfather was dying of chemo. It was only delaying the inevitable and he hated what it was doing so he opted to stop. Of course his wife and kids all objected and tried to sway him. But he knew that he had to accept it was coming and go out on what his terms could be at the time.

Hey friend, I'm so sorry for the lost of your beloved dog. My thoughts are with you during this difficult time. I' sending lots of hugs and love your way. Thank you. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. We took him in for a checkup and found out he had a ruptured tumor so it was completely unexpected. The worst part is that if we would've had $5000 we could've given him a chance. He was only 6. If anyone has any tips I'm open to hearing them. 		E: this comment has brought up a few comments about the finances. I shouldn't have even mentioned it. I explained below, we did have the money but it wasn't even a guarantee. It could've just gave him a couple more month of misery or he could've recovered. It was basically a $5000 gamble I suppose. I'm not sure if we made the right decision, but we did what we thought was right in the moment.

Every time she goes all the vet techs get all excited to see her, she gets tonnes of treats and she gets to see her favourite Vet Rosie so she had a great time there. One time she was going in for her spay but they couldn't carry it out because she'd gotten a bit of a skin infection on  the area they had to work on but since they'd already given her pre-meds, they decided to keep her in for the day for safety. She ended up spending the day behind the receptionist desk greeting all the animals that came in and had the whole run of the place!

Thank you. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. We took him in for a checkup and found out he had a ruptured tumor so it was completely unexpected. The worst part is that if we would've had $5000 we could've given him a chance. He was only 6. If anyone has any tips I'm open to hearing them. 		E: this comment has brought up a few comments about the finances. I shouldn't have even mentioned it. I explained below, we did have the money but it wasn't even a guarantee. It could've just gave him a couple more month of misery or he could've recovered. It was basically a $5000 gamble I suppose. I'm not sure if we made the right decision, but we did what we thought was right in the moment. When I lost my two cats, I read poems about pet loss. Sounds weird but it made me feel less alone in my grieving. There's also a reddit community over at /r/petloss if you want to post. I'm so sorry for your loss, we all have you in our thoughts.

Her strange habits and things like that.		Let yourself be sad when you need to. But, as cliche as it sounds, remembering the good times really does help.

I'm not sure what your financial situation is like, but the program You Need A Budget (also referred to as YNAB) has been instrumental in helping me accumulate an emergency fund for things like unexpected vet bills.

But also, $5000 is a good chunk of change, and it sounds like you gave him the most love-filled life he could have for the time he was with you.

My dad decided to put in $7000 to keep him alive miserably for a couple weeks, and then blamed it on my brother saying he asked for it.			Not the right subreddit for my post, but dogs deserve a peaceful ending, and it would have just left more anger for you if you had tried the opposite. 
No one could ever tell us for sure! He had a big underbite and was just shaggy as any dog you've seen. I got him from the shelter. I picked the "ugliest" dog I could find cause I knew it would be the least likely to get adopted. He was so goofy looking that it made him adorable I love shaggy dogs!! How big was he? What was he like? 
Really? I was thinking more of it being a comforting voice to them. How would they know you're validating their fears? If anything, they'll sense you're not tense or scaredI just remember reading it and it kind of makes sense.  Like a kid falling down and crying. Usually if it's not a bad fall they look at an adult, I'd the adult starts going "oh no muh baby!". That will make them cry when just acting like it's no big deal will prevent it.
wow that's adorable The vet thinks it's hilarious. He does that anti gravity "flat cat" move when they try and flip him around.  http://i.imgur.com/0r47p5b.jpg 
*wholesome thoughts wholesome thoughts wholesome thoughts*I wouldn't worry. Dogs can't even die. Hold on, let me get my conductor hat...		"Some of you, particularly those who think they have recently lost a dog to 'death', dont really understand this. Ive had no desire to explain, but wont be around forever and must.		Dogs never die. They dont know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they dont die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say: 'No, no, not a good idea. Let's not go for a walk.' Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that's what dogs are. They walk.		Its not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dogs mark, a rotting chicken bone (exultation), and you. Thats what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.		However, dogs get very very sleepy. Thats the thing, you see. They don't teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. Its a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.		When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging its tail madly, you see, and thats why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. Thats when they say: 'Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.'		When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and thats why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, its a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it's a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)		Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and dont want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.		But dont get fooled. They are not 'dead.' Theres no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when youre not expecting it. Its just who they are.		I feel sorry for people who dont have dogs sleeping in their heart. Youve missed so much."

I'm so sorry about your dog. :( especially since that was such unexpected news.

That's important to remember, I hope you don't beat yourself up for not having that kind of money. The thing is that we had the cash, it just wasn't even guaranteed to help him to live. There was a chance he could've had a few more years but if it was cancerous only 2 more months of mostly painful life. We had to make a tough decision. Right now we wish we would've made a different one about half the time. It's not a good feeling, but we did what we though was right in the moment. 
Give yourself time to grieve, it's OK to eventually move on and get another dog. It's what your dog would've wanted, for you to be happy.		Also, it's too late for your dog but it could have been you who was sick and needed the 5k. Consider making an emergency fund your top priority. R/personafinance has many tips on how to startLike I explained in another comment, we had the money, it just wasn't even guaranteed to help him to live. They said they weren't sure if he was stable enough to make it through and even if he did he might not make it much longer. But there was also a chance he could've fully recovered. It just seemed like the best decision at the time. :(

My dog of 15 years just went to sleep in my heart last week and he's been wagging his tail in my heart ever since. Thank you for this.		Edit: Thank you for the gold. I will pay it forward in due time.

We've got another dog now that is the same colouring as our old one. Our new one is a spunky little asshole that I like to think is how my old one was when she was a puppy. I wish I could've had both at the same time. It would've been awesome. 
Wrong sub for that kind of talk, brother. Unless you're feeling sad? Then this is the placeYeah, maybe the guy lost a dog recently. We ought to not shame him with our reckless downvotes.
Yes.:D
>i can totally relate to that.		can confirm, am dog?woof
that was a pocket on her shirtno.. u don't know her Story,,, for all weknow...she could born of POCKET BOOB..,,, 
The thing is that we had the cash, it just wasn't even guaranteed to help him to live. There was a chance he could've had a few more years but if it was cancerous only 2 more months of mostly painful life. We had to make a tough decision. Right now we wish we would've made a different one about half the time. It's not a good feeling, but we did what we though was right in the moment. If it were me, I would rather go peacefully, surrounded by my favorite people, than suffer for an undetermined amount of time.		My parents lost their 4 year old Golden recently. He had a few tumors which they got surgically removed. Turned out to be cancer. Unfortunately, the surgery made the tumors more aggressive and the cancer spread all throughout his abdomen. They tried everything, even radiation, but near the end they had to help Sammy defecate because he couldn't on his own.		By the time my parents decided to let him go, he was walking hunched over with his head down from the pain.		You did the right thing.

Right now we wish we would've made a different one about half the time. It's not a good feeling, but we did what we though was right in the moment. Dogs and cats and all pets give us what they can. Love, of course, but sometimes bites and worries and messes. They're not perfect, and they would never expect us to be. But in the end, the ones we love try to be good and we do the same. Unfortunately, we don't have the easiest decisions to make when it comes to these kinds of things. I think you did what was right even without considering the cost; you chose love like your dog would do without a second thought. 
Like I explained in another comment, we had the money, it just wasn't even guaranteed to help him to live. They said they weren't sure if he was stable enough to make it through and even if he did he might not make it much longer. But there was also a chance he could've fully recovered. It just seemed like the best decision at the time. :(If it was cancer it would have been a horrible couple of months. Experience. I've heard that when you have to put a pet down, you take their pain away and give it to yourself. That gives me comfort. The pain for me is horrible but he isn't in pain anymore.  
A kid speaks your language. If you spoke in German, I doubt the kid would realize.It has nothing to do with the verbal language.  It's all body language.

All of you!And you're a good boy! And you're a good boy!!You're all good boys!!! 
Well I'm not dog behaviorist so I'm not really sure on specifics.  Just read that comforting them when they're distressed helps reinforce that there is something for them to worry about.  		It wouldn't make me completely ignore my pet for a one off, but when they're constantly worried about let's say going on a walk, pretty sure continually  stopping to calm is counter productive.Also not a dog behaviorist, but dogs validate their behavior based on your response. If you tell them they are a good boy/girl and offer positive reinforcement, they will think their behavior is acceptable for the situation. What has worked best for me to reverse this is ignoring as much nervous behavior as possible and praising the dog when it is relaxed. This might be difficult at first, but the more you practice, the better and easier it gets. It's also important to take your dog to the vet at times other than appointments so they don't think the vet is only a place they get painful shots. If they get treats and leave every other trip to the vet, they'll be a lot more willing to go.

I feel like I'm missing the joke here, can someone please explain? Or am I looking too deep into it?It's the children's game "Simon Says".		One player is Simon, and he gives commands to the other players. If "Simon says" to do something, all other players must do that action. Otherwise, players must not do that action. Not doing an action that "Simon said", or doing an action that Simon didn't say to, results in that player being eliminated from the round.		In the op post, the first line is "Simon says touch your head", and because Simon said to do it, all players must touch their heads, those who don't are "out". The second line, "Now touch your nose", is **not** what Simon said, and any player who does touch their nose is out.		^(cc /u/Count_Cuckenstein)
Simon says enjoy your life and be grateful of your loved onesOK. Did I call my grandmother this week? Better do it!

Where did this meme start? I've missed it while living under my rock.From [Know Your Meme:](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/roll-safe)		> Roll Safe is an image macro serious featuring a screenshot of actor Kayode Ewumi grinning and pointing to his temple while portraying the character Reece Simpson (a.k.a. Roll Safe) in the web series Hood Documentary. The image is often captioned with various jokes mocking poor decision making and failures in critical thinking.

He didn't say Simon says Yeah, i still don't get it.	EDIT: Wow, i got so many upvotes for being an idiot, thanks guys i get it now. :D
I'm confused too. There's a childrens game called "Simon says". In it the leader says "Simon says" followed by a simple instruction (normally to touch one body part or another). If the leader doesn't say "Simon says" before giving an instruction, you are not supposed to follow that instruction. If you follow the instruction you lost the game.		In this meme, he is following the rules of the game.
OK. Did I call my grandmother this week? Better do it!But Simon didn't say.
Simon says smile.:D

Michael may be a half wit, but God damnit is he the most sincere character there is. That was always his redeeming trait. He didn't always understand how to be humorous or politically correct and he often misunderstood complicated situations, but everything he did he did wholeheartedly and with the intention to make other people happy.		He was Dunder-Mifflin's best salesman in the 90s because of those traits, and, in my opinion, *the most subtle joke* is that Michael is a manager, and here's why: the company promoted their best salesman rather than hiring a good manager. Just because a person is good at a particular set of tasks or skills *does not* mean they'll be any good at *managing others* who are trying to perform those tasks or skills.

David Brent is a jackass until you see a human side to him, showing that he really cares for people.

Then right at the end he does one small thing that shows he's a deeply caring person.
Michael may be a half wit, but God damnit is he the most sincere character there is. The episode with the deposition really showed just how loyal he was. Michael Scott was a true OG. David Wallace is right up there too in my books.

As I wipe the happy tears from my eyes, could someone give me context please, I never watched the American Office.Her coworkers visited the gallery and did the phony "say it's lovely to her face, trash it behind her back" which she overheard. Art had been her passion and getting such negative feedback was devastating.		Then, at the very end of the day, Michael (the guy in the picture), her immature, douchey, often inappropriate boss comes in and legitimately compliments her art without a hint of BS. He particularly falls in love with a simplistic drawing she did of the office they work at, and tries to buy it so he can hang it in the office.		It's a very nice moment.

As I wipe the happy tears from my eyes, could someone give me context please, I never watched the American Office.People are leaving out that her fianc (a dumb hothead guy who treats Pam like crap, and who she later dumps) stopped by with his brother, looked at it for about five seconds and then said something that basically amounted to "yeah hey, I looked at it ok? We're gonna go have a beer now"
As I wipe the happy tears from my eyes, could someone give me context please, I never watched the American Office.Pam is showing some of her art at a local exhibit. It's all inspired off her (seemingly) mundane office life. Nobody really appreciates it- then later in the episode Michael comes in and loves it. To others it is just a cold building, but Michael and Pam it is ther home and family.
As I wipe the happy tears from my eyes, could someone give me context please, I never watched the American Office.Go, go watch it right now, all of it. It is so so so so so so incredibly good.
As I wipe the happy tears from my eyes, could someone give me context please, I never watched the American Office.Basically she is an aspiring artist and entered her drawing into a gallery. Nobody really showed up and those who did, were way to critical. Michael genuinely cared about her and her dreams and they hung the painting in the office because he liked it so much. It was really the first time anyone(besides Jim really) seemed to care about what she actually enjoyed
that scene always crushes me I only just started watching the Office recently and that scene legit made me cry. Probably because I relate to Pam a lot and her whole story arc in that season is so damn real and it is just a reminder of how much one person believing in you can help you.

Every once in a while there are people in your life that not only deserve validation but need it.

Not only does validation feel wonderful to receive, but it feels incredible to give. 		Giving a small thing like a kind word or smile means a lot.  Don't miss an opportunity to appreciate someone!

That whole show is like a wholesome meme. Maybe not Scott's tots
Favorite line from this episode: 		"being a good manager isn't about firing people it's about hiring people and inspiring people. People... Ryan. And people, will never go out of business""Your art is the prettiest art of all the art"
No show has ever hit me over the head with emotion so unexpectedly. Michael Scott proved we can all find someone to love us just like we are

I see this at my job constantly. Often, someone good at a job will get promoted to manager as a reward and then they suck at it. Just let them be good at their job and reward them with - MORE MONEY! It is pretty simple. Just look at sports. The best players on the team will always make way more than the coach/manager. And you don't try to make your best player the coach.

He's a selfish wanker who will never be loved by anyone no matter how desperately he craves it. A lonely, tragic loser with essentially no positive attributes.		The US office is just a happier, more optimistic show in general though. They go for more of a 'wacky family' vibe than the miserable realism the UK version is known for.

Then Michael shows up late and is really nice about Pam's art. 		It's pretty much the catalyst in Pam's storyline that changes her from being quite meek and reserved to more assertive.

Maybe not Scott's totsBut it is wholesome. Michael doesn't promise to pay for those kids' college out of malice, he does it because he legit thought he'd be a millionaire by then and he wanted to help them. And at the end the teacher mentions that everyone in that class graduated, unlike the rest of the school. He believed in them and that alone helped a lot.
Maybe not Scott's totsThat's by far my least favorite episode in the series. It's soul crushing
"I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them."		That show could be surprisingly inspirational. My favorite quote from when Kevin and his team won trivia night:		"Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was. But here's a piece of trivia: A fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea, So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are... you just might catch one."
That is what makes it so hard to dislike him. You want to because he's a bad manager, but you don't want to because he's not evil, he's just not suited to management. He really cares about everyone he works with, he just struggles to express it appropriately sometimes. It explains why Stanley resents him so much. He and Stanley have worked together for a long time, and there was probably a time when they were equals (both salesmen). Stanley might have even liked Michael at the time, enjoying his gregarious, friendly personality. 		When Michael was promoted, Stanley was probably one of the first poeple he alienated, in that he kept trying to be his friend but also had to be his boss, which is pretty much impossible to do. By the time we are introduced to the characters, it's pretty clear that Stanley thinks he is an incompetent manager and no longer considers him a friend. While aloof and impersonal, Stanley *does* know a lot of things about Michael.

The amount of company outings and parties usually results in improved camaraderie and generally good morale. Every person he hires has a specific personality and role that fits within the ecosystem of the company. 		In the first season, Jim dreaded the idea of moving up in the company/staying there for any extended amount of time. Jim was perhaps the smartest and most naturally talented person in the company region. But he had the job because he wasn't motivated to do something challenging. In the end, the most challenging thing for him was finding love and being secure in his job. Something that under Michael (and maybe only under Michael), he was capable of doing. And he stayed with the company as a result. 		Sure, he's offensive and disruptive, but he produces results and everyone was sad when he left (except maybe Stanley/Toby). I find Michael extremely naive, but naturally harmless and truly caring about the people he was leading.

He's a petty, childish man with no real desire to better himself when it comes to his coworkers. I feel bad for him because it's clear his childhood was pretty messed up too, but I just can't bring myself to like him.

She basically just had a super shitty couple hours before Michael showed up, so she really needed to hear that.

'roll of quarters .... Laundry day.'
seconded!! at the school i work at we give the students merits based on actions rooted in our core values (curiosity, community, courage, tenacity, and integrity). anytime a student asks for help or admits that they're lost i give them an integrity merit because being open about your vulnerabilities is, in my opinion, the truest form of honesty. 		you, u/mudd_butt, get an integrity merit today. 		(and a community for you, u/believe_the_hype2018!)I always wanted a merit and I always wanted a community. Thank you for giving me a bit of both 
It's more that out of all Pam's co-workers, initially only Oscar came to the gallery, and ended up insulting Pam behind her back with his boyfriend. Then Michael shows up late and is really nice about Pam's art. 		It's pretty much the catalyst in Pam's storyline that changes her from being quite meek and reserved to more assertive. It's more than just Michael being nice though, it's that he's established to have no filter whatsoever, and ALWAYS goes for the joke even at the worst possible time. Generally speaking, he's bad at reading "cues". 		So when he shows up late, his appreciation of the art just comes across as so genuine. Best part, Pam is just looking for some basic appreciation, but he offers to buy it. He's at an art gallery, isn't he? She's spent the entire day questioning herself and thinking she's a shitty artist, and here comes oblivious Michael who not only likes it, but wants to purchase it. His assumption is that it has to be for sale, why wouldn't it be? Even when she hugs him he still has no idea how much joy he's brought her.

His douchiness only comes as a second order effect of his overall idiocy. He sincerely cares about everyone in the office (except toby).I don't think Michael is a douche. He's just socially inept and has no filter.

wow that was really touching and then they throw in a random dick joke and completely ruin it...Well that's kind of taken out of context. If you watch that whole episode just before Michael got to the art show he was at a college campus doing a presentation and he kept pulling out random candy bars that would create puns and then throw them into the crowd. For example "If you sell enough paper you will make a "One Hundred Grand" and that is a "Payday"". So when he gets to the art 	exhibit its only fitting that he has that chunky in his pocket and they squeeze out another pun.
wow that was really touching and then they throw in a random dick joke and completely ruin it...Well, that's Michael's whole shtick. He's caring and nice but also cringy and would probably be fired based on sexual harassment WAY before the show even aired if this was real.
wow that was really touching and then they throw in a random dick joke and completely ruin it...That's The Office for ya!

He said (earnestly), "Your art was the prettiest of all the art." In a way it's worse than being dismissive, because it shows that even when he's trying his best, he doesn't really get Pam and her passions. Your art... is the prettiest art... out of all the art.		So, you coming back to my place tonight?
I did. Thank you very much :) How much? I don't see a price.

My favorite quote from when Kevin and his team won trivia night:		"Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was. But here's a piece of trivia: A fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea, So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are... you just might catch one."One of my favorite episodes!
It explains why Stanley resents him so much. He and Stanley have worked together for a long time, and there was probably a time when they were equals (both salesmen). Stanley might have even liked Michael at the time, enjoying his gregarious, friendly personality. 		When Michael was promoted, Stanley was probably one of the first poeple he alienated, in that he kept trying to be his friend but also had to be his boss, which is pretty much impossible to do. By the time we are introduced to the characters, it's pretty clear that Stanley thinks he is an incompetent manager and no longer considers him a friend. While aloof and impersonal, Stanley *does* know a lot of things about Michael.Thats why the episode where Michael fires Stanley for making fun of him was hard to watch. You can tell Stanley is genuinely upset at Michaels behavior and he just snaps. Then they both make up when michael says it was a joke and Stanley promises to be nicer to him

Sometimes it was easy for me to dislike him because he did selfish things that *didn't* have other people's interest in mind.Like the time he went for the bonus for ending a year with remaining budget money instead of buying new chairs or copy machine for the office.

Sometimes it was easy for me to dislike him because he did selfish things that *didn't* have other people's interest in mind.The episode where Dwight gets a concussion and Michael only cares about his foot ticks me off soo bad. 
Is he a bad manager? His branch consistently leads in sales. The amount of company outings and parties usually results in improved camaraderie and generally good morale. Every person he hires has a specific personality and role that fits within the ecosystem of the company. 		In the first season, Jim dreaded the idea of moving up in the company/staying there for any extended amount of time. Jim was perhaps the smartest and most naturally talented person in the company region. But he had the job because he wasn't motivated to do something challenging. In the end, the most challenging thing for him was finding love and being secure in his job. Something that under Michael (and maybe only under Michael), he was capable of doing. And he stayed with the company as a result. 		Sure, he's offensive and disruptive, but he produces results and everyone was sad when he left (except maybe Stanley/Toby). I find Michael extremely naive, but naturally harmless and truly caring about the people he was leading.I think it was largely Dwight that made them successful. When Jim leaves and Ryan takes over some of his clients, they don't talk about the other salesmen struggling. When Dwight is fired the other salesmen all struggle for a while because Dwight had so many clients and because he password protected their files with different mythological clients.		When Andy is manager but away sailing, the office does really well, mainly because Dwight gets clients.		The other salesmen do well too; Jim can make his numbers easily, Stanley has the most consistent sales, Phyllis knows how to smooze her clients like getting the giant bouffant hairstyle. Andy and Pam were the weak links sales wise.
Except with Toby because fuck TobyToby is the embodiment of the traits that Michael wants to suppress. Awkwardness, melancholy, unsocial, task orientated (instead of people). He hates him for the same reason that reddit downvotes comments that are seen as trying too hard to be funny. They want to disassociate themselves from behavior they are suppressing. 
Except with Toby because fuck TobyHey, Toby is doing his best and doesn't want to hurt anyone. Remember where you are friend.
Except with Toby because fuck Toby["I want today to be a beautiful memory. And if Toby is part of it, then it'll *suck*"](https://youtu.be/np152Jjq9U8?t=57)
Didn't they repeatedly state that his branch was the only successful one and even didn't lose a client when they absorbed the other branch?		I thought the show made it out that even though he wasted tons of time and did what he did, that he somehow was kind of an idiot savant managerHe's also complimented for trimming the budget after absorbing Stanford which is actually funny when you think about it because he only managed to do that because most of the Stanford employees couldn't deal with his management style and quit.

He would occasionally make crazy smart choices like the golden ticket that kept them number one. 
But often those people ask for it. If your best sales person wants to move up to an open spot you can't really say no. They'll go somewhere else instead. You just pay them more.
If someone is good at what they do, promote them until they aren't.These things actually happen.		Happened to me while I was in college.		I got hired for a job I was unqualified for, and I had to learn on-the-job. The other people I worked with were smarter than I was, not just concerning the job, but in general.		I was promoted and got raises and eventually was their boss, in a way.		Yeah they fucking hated me.
There's a decent reason it happens, though. If the company keeps giving people raises without promoting them, they still have to pay the higher rate to the manager. It won't do to have the manager making less than the employees, after all. So in the end, they just wind up paying everyone way more, and they might not be able to/want to afford that.> It won't do to have the manager making less than the employees, after all.		This is flawed logic and leads to the scenario I described above.
That and the fact you can tell Michael isn't just saying it to be nice after all the negative comments, he actually loves it and that's so wholesomeThat's why this is my favorite scene from the Office - Michael absolutely means it when he fawns over her work. Just because it sounds silly - "these could be tracings!" - it's easy to view another way, but you have to remember that to Michael, someone who doesn't know anything about art, this is the highest form of praise he could probably manage to articulate. He's actually really, genuinely enjoying her work and makes a genuine emotional connection with her portrait of the office building. 		It ends up being worth more to Pam than even if the entire office had showed up and patronized her, which was probably what Pam's imagined best case scenario was. Instead she got someone to really appreciate her as an artist and feel something real from her work. 
Which is pretty much the difference between UK TV and US TV (generally speaking)		US TV is very very romanticized. There is a lot of redemption, people falling in love, people patching up countless times, etc etc. It feels good, but it doesn't feel real.I've actually read it's more of a reflection of how people in the US glorify mindless work culture and people in the UK see it as...mindless work culture. 		People in the US think they're gonna make it big and this is just temporary work, so they make it meaningful. People in the UK see it more bleakly

There's a moment where IIRC, at the bar she orders a Diet Coke and a normal coke and gets two normal cokes, and musters up the courage to speak up to the bartender about it. 		And then most obviously there's the Beach Games episode where she does the fire walk and then speaks to Jim about how it's weird they haven't been hanging out, in front of everyone.

Oscars boyfriend Gill really ripped into her, and called it "motel art". Oscar sort of tried to defend her saying she was only starting.Yeah, and Oscar essentially says that Pam isn't brave, which is what leads to her becoming more assertive. 
I don't think Michael is a douche. He's just socially inept and has no filter. He was a jerk initially but his character evolved as they moved away from the British version. He's a dramatically different character than David Brent. 
Fuck Toby tho amirite? Hey buddy, please remember this is /r/wholesomememes		But yeah, fuck toby
I actually have to agree with you. This is one of the reasons I love Community so much. Sometimes they can just have honest heartwarming moments without anything else happening.One snapshot is all this is.  The Office has many more moments like this that are more effective than anything in community.  Point blank if you are looking for a touching comedy the office is a better show.

Like the time he went for the bonus for ending a year with remaining budget money instead of buying new chairs or copy machine for the office.I think that's because he didn't want to let either side down. So being the guy he is he somehow thought the bonus would be better than letting half the office down. Maybe... I could be wrong	
The episode where Dwight gets a concussion and Michael only cares about his foot ticks me off soo bad. It's a symptom of one of his character flaws which is a lack of self awareness. It's not that others aren't dealing with selfish thoughts, but he doesn't filter.		Plus he's also kind of an asshole but I think he grows a bit.

It is kind of odd that Dwight was the top salesperson since he was so awkward and had such a strange personality, without much charisma or charm. 		The best trait that Michael had as a manager was that he genuinely cared about his employees.  He tried to be respectful and make everyone comfortable and happy. On many occasions he failed, but he genuinely wanted everyone to like him. If his staff had not been sales-oriented and self sufficient, the branch would have failed, but he got lucky and had a good crew. 		Ryan was absolutely terrible, he sucked at sales and was shady and manipulative.  Michael was a very poor judge of character and never picked up on Ryan's flaws.

He's also complimented for trimming the budget after absorbing Stanford which is actually funny when you think about it because he only managed to do that because most of the Stanford employees couldn't deal with his management style and quit.He fired the fat guy when he tried to quit and they had to pay a severance though. 
My fav was when he started his own paper company and jacked all of Dunder Mifflins clients, which backfired on him and then un-backfired on him. Ahh the good ol' michael loopdelooI love the closing of that arc, the scene where he is in negotiations with David Wallace.		David is trying to hard ball him into a buy out, saying "I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way...This is the best offer you're going to get."		and in this uncharacteristic moment of competence, Michael says, "I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation - YOUR company is losing clients left and right. YOU have a stock-holder meeting coming up, and you're going to have to explain to them, why their most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I have to wait out Dunder Mifflin... I think I just have to wait out you." Mic drop.		I wish I could just find the scene on youtube, but it's season 5, episode 25. My favorite scene.
These things actually happen.		Happened to me while I was in college.		I got hired for a job I was unqualified for, and I had to learn on-the-job. The other people I worked with were smarter than I was, not just concerning the job, but in general.		I was promoted and got raises and eventually was their boss, in a way.		Yeah they fucking hated me.Sounds like imposter syndrome. Don't sell yourself short. Being intelligent and self conscious enough to recognize your own flaws, but generous and forgiving to excuse other's is a good thing. Holding yourself to an unachievable standard makes you a continually better person, but that doesn't mean you should discount what you are now or minimize your progress 
I've actually read it's more of a reflection of how people in the US glorify mindless work culture and people in the UK see it as...mindless work culture. 		People in the US think they're gonna make it big and this is just temporary work, so they make it meaningful. People in the UK see it more bleaklyThe thing about that so-called mindless work culture that makes it worth it is the people. I've always been friends with my co-workers and that makes working somewhere more than just a job. I've been to weddings, baby showers, election parties, "no more cancer" parties, death bed, countless long lunches, LAN parties, you name it. If you're going to spend half your day somewhere you might as well make a meaningful connection with the people your spending that time with.		I think the office focused on the interpersonal interactions rather than the work because that's what's actually interesting.

The best trait that Michael had as a manager was that he genuinely cared about his employees.  He tried to be respectful and make everyone comfortable and happy. On many occasions he failed, but he genuinely wanted everyone to like him. If his staff had not been sales-oriented and self sufficient, the branch would have failed, but he got lucky and had a good crew. 		Ryan was absolutely terrible, he sucked at sales and was shady and manipulative.  Michael was a very poor judge of character and never picked up on Ryan's flaws. Dwight was driven, Jim had better people skills but where he would eventually blow off working more Dwight would keep going, working weekends and holidays as is mentioned several times. He's also probably the most knowledgeable about the industry so he's got a no nonsense approach that probably works in a world of smoozing.
Mythological clients...like Recyclops?The evolution of Recyclops is perhaps the greatest story told on television.
I always thought he just hated Toby because he took Holly's placeNah, he hated Toby from the beginning 
I always thought he just hated Toby because he took Holly's placeHe hated Toby because he's HR. HR isn't a part of the Scranton "family" per say since HR is just a representative for corporate. Anytime Michael wants to do something fun, Toby has to step in because he's there for corporate, not for Michael. 
I always thought he just hated Toby because he took Holly's placeThere's a brilliant fan theory that he hates Toby because he senses there's somethiing not right about him, and there's something not right about him because [he's the Scranton Strangler.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ceihg/toby_is_the_true_scranton_strangler_motives/)
I apologize, that was hateful and unnecessary.But understandable. I mean, it is Toby we're talking about here...
I love the closing of that arc, the scene where he is in negotiations with David Wallace.		David is trying to hard ball him into a buy out, saying "I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way...This is the best offer you're going to get."		and in this uncharacteristic moment of competence, Michael says, "I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation - YOUR company is losing clients left and right. YOU have a stock-holder meeting coming up, and you're going to have to explain to them, why their most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I have to wait out Dunder Mifflin... I think I just have to wait out you." Mic drop.		I wish I could just find the scene on youtube, but it's season 5, episode 25. My favorite scene.Pam's smile to the camera is great in that scene. She knew Michael could pull it off, and so did we. It's great, because Michael is just a genuinely competent salesman. Like others have said, he just couldn't handle being a boss too well.
Aww, shucks, I'm not even a fan of the Office and all this meaning warmed my heart!!!Yeah American Office is just great.
Wowwwwwww forgot that was the A-plot of the episode. Great point there, that adds such a motivation to there Michael is coming from when he sees Pam's drawings.		Freaking Steve Carrell should have gotten an Emmy. He's such an amazing comedic actor and really brought so much pathos to Michael Scott. I'm rewatching the scene on youtube thinking about what you've said and now I see it in Michael's face. Woosh.Steve Carell never got an Emmy for 'Thr Office'? The guy practically made the show. That's surprising. 
I think he is almost entirely happy that she used paper and is indifferent to the actual art. Kinda ruins that special moment but thats Michael for you.Well she had other drawings displayed but he loved the office picture most. He's a man who pretty much dedicated his life to work seeing as he doesn't really have anyone around outside of the office. I feel like it's a perfect storm of him needing validation for his career choice. 
I even think "jerk" is too strong to describe him. "jerk" implies malice and I truly believe that Michael Scott doesn't do things out of malice, just ignorance (except for anything involving Toby, but he's not part of The Office family, and he's divorced so he's not part of his family either).I'm thinking of the first episode where he makes Pam cry and she calls him a jerk.

He always realizes what's he's doing and tries to make amends by the end of the episode, but he's definitely a pretty big jerk sometimes

Surely it's also because he's lucky enough to have Jim and Dwight as salesmen.That's likely part of it., Which also support OP'S point that the sales skill drives the branches success, compensating for its administration inefficiencies
King of queens. How did Kevin land the hot wife?  For audience ratings.  No need to overthink that one.

He's also probably the most knowledgeable about the industry so he's got a no nonsense approach that probably works in a world of smoozing.Idk there were so many episodes where Jim made it obvious that he was able to finish all his work extremely fast and when there was no longer a commission cap he sold a ton until it came back and he met it so fast that he ended up not doing anything because he didn't earn any commission. 		Also, let's not forget the episodes where Michael really shows what made him qualified to be a manager, such as when he's called in by Dwight and Jim to help secure and client and he nails it right away, and when he goes with Jan to meet a big client and gets them easily.		I think that all the salesmen were extremely knowledgeable and did their jobs, Dwight was just exceptional and went above and beyond. But everyone else did just fine and completed all of their work as well.

Yeah American Office is just great.I'm much more likely to watch UK shows but happened to watch the US Office first and can't really get into the original version.

He doesn't necessarily thrive in it, he's just more accustomed to those situations than anyone else.
Especially since season 9 was such a great return to form. What a final 4 episodes too, just so good...I've watched seasons 1-6 more times than I can count, I've watched it all the way through 5 times total.  The last episodes still make my eyes water man.  I mean damn dude.  It's SOOOO good
Especially since season 9 was such a great return to form. What a final 4 episodes too, just so good...I've never watched the last 10 episodes, and I've watch the series through probably 3 or 4 times. I'd just be too sad that it's over.

I'm not on the Big Bang theory hate bandwagon but come on.I mean, dislike or disregard the show all you want but Jim Parsons does an incredible job as an actor on the show. He's the only reason it's as popular as it is.

One of the Lions looks like it's tilting. They understood perspective back then?Oh you are in for a treat if you're curious about that. 		An entire subsection of the art historical field focuses on the development of movement in imagery. 		To answer your question: probably. I'm no expert on prehistoric imagery, but bodily movement in images changes and fluctuates through time, so it's entirely possible. 
One of the Lions looks like it's tilting. They understood perspective back then?So I'm taking an art history class right now, so I'm claiming to have put a ton of research into this or that I'm an expert by any means, but I thought I'd just echo what I've learned on the subject.		Basically, [yeah](http://s3.amazonaws.com/presspublisher-do/upload/2697/horses2.jpg), they understood depth, detail and shading. In fact a ton of the deep cave drawings made during the neolithic period are really surprisingly well done, and those horses were made friggin 30,000 years ago! Then something weird happens when agriculture comes a long and suddenly everything is [stick figures](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/064_Pintures_de_la_cova_dels_Moros,_exposici%C3%B3_al_Museu_de_Gav%C3%A0.JPG) and abstract shapes. Those stick figures were made roughly ***24,000*** years after the horses. Seriously, it's bonkers.		Here's the thinking. In pre-agriculture times, peeps had to keep on the move in order to follow their food source. This made the making of art pretty rare as it either has to be [small enough to carry with you](http://www.dominiquenavarro.com/imagesdom/Venus%20of%20Willendorf/Venus-of-Willendorf_03.jpg) or it had to have some serious religious significance! So this large cave paintings were made by like shamans and stuff with the thought that the animals on the walls would guide the local medicine man safely into the spirit world or whatever. For that reason they put a lot of effort into making the pictures do the real creatures justice.		Then people start settling down and so more people have time to make paintings. Now they aren't doing it so much out of religious desire and more for telling stories and keeping record of their people. Less skilled people are painting now, and they are spending less time making sure it's perfect and accurate the first time because they can just make more later. Real interesting stuff.

I'm sorry you feel that way. I was just voicing my opinion.

It's not that we disagree with you and you hurt our feelings, it's that you're objectively wrong and kind of judgemental.
Oh there is certainly a noticeable decline in artistic standards since the early 1900's. It's okay, we all have different perspectives so I understand if we disagree :)Perhaps you misunderstood; what RainSnowHall is saying is that the artistic decline in OP's comic is just your interpretation, while their interpretation is that the modern drawing is worse because it's drawn by a stand-in for the reader, who likely hasn't drawn many great pieces of art.

MANLY POOP!!!Poop that's rocking a rad moustache?
Now here's a little lesson in trickery This is going down in history
Wait whatIt was in the Super Mario Galaxy play-through, when Danny lamented his poor art skills. Arin, who did quite a bit of animation a while back (i.e. Metal Gear Awesome) explained that the only reason he's good at drawing is because he practiced a lot.		He then likened the idea of always being good at something to absurdity, such as if he emerged from his mother's vaginal canal drawing fuckin' Mozart.
It used to be objective. "Beauty in the eye of the beholder" being a commonplace belief is a relatively recent phenomenon, somewhere within the last century.		And like I said, there is awesome work out there right now but personally I just don't think it rivals with the architecture and other things we were building/creating in real life.What? No it didn't. Philosophers from Plato to Hume have been discussing subjective standards of taste and art. You are just factually wrong. 		What IS true is that there were less forms of art, which you seem to be confusing as evidence of objectivity. What this really shows is that you're unwilling to consider new perspectives, a key and necessary ingredient in the entire history of the development of art. 
>there has always been huge controversy in art		I wouldn't say huge, hence many objective art cultures surviving and improving on a relatively stable scale for hundreds of years within their nations. The times we are living in are profoundly different than the old days. It's best not to look at the past through the goggles of modernity.Can you give me a single example of an artistic landscape that remained unchanged for hundreds of years?
> what's the point		Terrible attitude!! We should always strive to get closer and closer to perfection. That is literally the main engine that powered our art for hundreds of years, like the picture in OP describes. We always wanted to be great like the masters, and leaving that as a constant force for artists to aspire to is, in my opinion, necessary for a healthy art culture. People see it as negative because sometimes we might not be as good as the masters, but that is where effort, hard work, and dedication can make us not only better artists, but better people as well :)>Terrible attitude!! We should always strive to get closer and closer to perfection. 		What you're describing isn't "closer to perfection." It's just lack of ambition and fear of trying something new. Modern artists haven't stopped striving for perfection. They're just doing it in different ways.
Well that's just rude.You don't get to complain about rudeness when you're being arrogant. The decline you speak of is subjective to your perspective. There is no objective beauty. You're being down voted because in a sub where kindness is the #1 rule, you're presenting a negative opinion as fact. That's what makes your comment not wholesome.
I would argue that promoting atomized individualistic art cultures is unwholesome but maybe I'm just old-fashioned. To each their own.That has nothing to do with our conversation. Bring that discussion to an art subreddit, perhaps you'll find like-minded people. However, in this one you won't be as successful. 
I guess it's just my opinion but I will stand by it - there has been a tremendous decline in art. I am judgemental; observation and conviction are our only truly unalienable rights as human beings. To say that I'm objectively wrong is kind of ironic when trying to argue against my point, is it not? Anyway, I just find that atomized individualistic art culture to be less wholesome than something everyone can come together and agree upon.Not that you shouldn't have opinions, but you didn't want to discuss the topic and that could include people telling you you're wrong.		I just think discounting art because it's new is the wrong outlook to have. The whole point of this comic is that you can only see true greatness in hindsight and 100 years from now someone will say there hasn't been great art since before 2000.		Saying there aren't GOAT artists anymore isn't very wholesome I'm because there are probably a lot of artists in this thread that want to strive for greatness but there are always people who will shoot them down because their ideas are modern and different, so they're inherently bad.
This is very true. But I think there is a big difference between Photoshop art which you can make errors on and press undo, with real art where if you make one big mistake you have to start all over again. It's just an entirely different craft with entirely different ways to appreciate it.You don't start over if you mess up with traditional art tho.  Erasers are a thing, and with paint you let the mistake dry and do it over (editing) or wipe it off (undo).  I practice art digitally and traditionally.  They're both absolutely art.		If you meant "real art" to mean "traditional art", disregard this.
>That's pretty dumb.		Well geez people get hostile real quick here. What happened to this sub? First week this place was only inhabited by nice people.sorry I guess I should have added a smiley at the end lmao.
The thing is that if your work survives, you really don't know 'cause you'll be death, whereas if you have fun or find meaning in your own work, you'll know. You don't know if your work survives.	You also don't know how long your work will survive. Someday no one will know who Picasso is. Sure, that may be after all humans are dead, but it will happen eventually.
No because best is a comparison. Without something to conpare it to it doesnt default to being the best, since itd also be the worst defeating the point of comparison.Yeah, it would be both the best *and* the worst.

It was about how only art of certain styles is aesthetically pleasing, which 1) implies no one makes "classical style" art anymore (they do), 2) that all art from this fabled, undated period of "real art" all fit into the box OP is trying to imply, and 3) none of the styles rejecting classical ideas have any artistic merit whatsoever. 
Beauty being an objective quality of the world was the ethos of artistic culture for hundreds of years. I don't have much else to say besides that.

Sure, there are hundreds of cultures with beautiful art histories that show this in action to choose from! Roman art is a great example, so we'll start there. Even if you exclude the thousands of years of ancient Roman art (which is all similar in many ways) you can see consistency through the Roman Empire's art which existed from 27BC to 1453AD. Everything you see [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=roman+art+sculpture+bc&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY-6C_uIPSAhVC42MKHRE7AfgQ_AUICCgB&biw=1673&bih=967#tbm=isch&q=roman+art+sculpture) comes from within those time periods. I'd say that's a good example of VERY clear objectivity and long-standing artistic tradition. Hope that helps :)But if the beauty of that art is so supposedly objective, why did so many varying styles of art evolve from isolated cultures? Would you not suppose that the "objectivity" of the beauty of that art is just a collective, societal, accumulation of personal view of beauty? My specialty is music, and I know that now we listen to music (considered universally beautiful) that was considered radically disgusting in the past.

I'd say that's a good example of VERY clear objectivity and long-standing artistic tradition. Hope that helps :)The example you're giving is not nearly as stagnant as you seem to think. Follow those sculptures chronologically, and you can see revolutionary changes in perspectives throughout time. You can see different styles from attempted photorealism to stoicism. Sculpting individual busts and likenesses to entire scenes and events with varying amounts of detail given to different subjects in the work based on which art-culture was predominant at that specific time. I agree that change took much longer back then, but you can't seriously believe that it just didn't happen.
Asian culture did the same thing for hundreds and hundreds of years. I'm not sure what you're missing here. Go look at Roman art between 27 BC and 1400 AD. Objective artist beauty, whether or not it "actually" existed, was a thing. It is very unwholesome to deny reality.> Go look at Roman art between 27 BC and 1400 AD. 		Just because artistic culture in that specific place at that specific time was stagnant, small, unambitious, and closed off from other perspectives doesn't mean "objective" beauty was a thing. 		> Objective artist beauty, whether or not it "actually" existed, was a thing. It is very unwholesome to deny reality. 		Just stop. This isn't even a debate. You're just objectively wrong. Their art looked similar because that's what their culture thought was beautiful. There were many other cultures around the world that thought very differently of what was beautiful at that time, so no, this thing you're calling "objective beauty" simply was not a thing. Your hypocrisy and outright misinformation is what's unwholesome. That's why you're being downvoted. 
And that is why I believe in the decline.Alright, well you have fun looking at soulless photorealism and whining about society falling apart because kids these days, and I'll look at art that makes me feel things. Or maybe you can just do what you said and stick to art from before WWII, like Duchamp's Fountain (1917) or Stravinsky's Rite of Spring (1913). After all, you're clearly really knowledgeable about art, and didn't pull your cutoff for when art started "declining" out of your ass.
And now you're being rude too. Whether or not some people want to accept it, objective beauty was a thing, and it was everything for artists for quite some time."objetive beauty is a thing to me and a lot of people!" well is not for me. You know what that means? It means is subjective. 
>You don't start over if you mess up with traditional art tho.		Oh, but you do! This was and still is the hardest part about sculpting. There's more art than just things you can erase with rubber.		Also I don't see things as "traditional" and "non-traditional" art. I just value objective beauty standards over personal expression, but this opinion of course can only be seen as something subjective in modern art culture since objectivity is all but dead.What do you, personally, start over with, if you mess up?  I work with clay, I paint, I draw, I craft.  There's never been a time where I put a lot of effort into a piece, and then had to completely start over due to a single mistake.  Not ever.  My dog sat on a drying canvas once, that's the only time, and the same thing would happen if she unplugged my computer while I was doing digital art.		Traditional art means art that isn't digital.  Digital art is self-explanatory.  You can't just not believe in terms that mean something.  Traditional art as a term has nothing to do with time periods or expression.
Well, I mean, it sounds like everyone else read him sharing his opinion as insisting it's fact but the way he came off to me entirely sounded like he was stating his opinion and people were jumping up saying that there's no basis for him to even think that one certain art style is superior to another.The point is his/her use of 'objective' for what is essentially his/her opinion. Nothing wrong with having an opinion, claiming it is objective that's what people don't like.
>It was objective from their point of view, which kinda makes it subjective.		Great point!! But, on a societal scale I would still say that it was far more "objective" in a sense than just one individual's idea of objective beauty, making it far more profound to think about.I can see exactly where you're coming from, like, a greater artistic collective rather than many more minor sub-cultures, if I understand you right. Personally, I prefer the individual having more power to decide what is and isn't beautiful. But, like I said, I appreciate what you're saying.
> Would you not suppose that the "objectivity" of the beauty of that art is just a collective, societal, accumulation of personal view of beauty? 		That is exactly what I think it is. It is still subjective to that entire society, which I think makes it all the more beautiful and appreciable from an outside perspective. A whole society appreciating something is far more powerful than just one individual's opinion.But wouldn't you consider modernist movements to be a form of that societal appreciation of a specific aspect of art, with that aspect being newness? 
You misread my post, I said it *was* a thing. Of course it is gone now, people clearly react rabidly against it without even reading clearly.How do you explain the wildly different standards of artistic beauty between say Western Europe, the Middle East and China in the past?
Clay is one thing, but try sculpting with stone or wood and you'll see what I mean.I see. So clay sculptures, paintings, and pencil drawings aren't real art?
I'm supposed to research your point for you that disagrees with my claim? A point that I don't even fully understand and thereby would be unsure what to even Google? That's not how a discussion works. I provided evidence for my claim, it is your turn to do the same. Wholesome discussions require effort from both sides in a conversation. 		Please, provide a source for your claim. I am not being rude by telling you you are being stubborn. You can't hide behind the wholesomeness of the sub just because people disagree with you. No one has been rude to you. At least I haven't.This guy is like "why do you downvote me, I though this was /r/wholesomememes!" while being incredibly rude, wrong, and arguing about downvotes.

Have a good one :)Plato's The Republic and Hume's On the Standard of Taste are two works that refute your historical claim. 		Your turn :) :) :) :)

He did break up Ann in such a positive way she didn't even know they had broken up.Do you know close to which episode or season? There are too many for me to guess. 
I know a dude who is like this "literally" IRL.  		He's so positive that it's contagious.  He obviously works at a local sporting goods store and is an outdoor enthusiast.  He got me into road biking and LOVES my dog.I want to meet this guy
He gets really depressed in the middle seasons though But ultimately, coming out the other side of his depression he's not just back to 100% positivity, but back to 100% positivity *and* living a more balanced, less stressful life than he was before his depression.
He gets really depressed in the middle seasons though But it's a wholesome depression.

What's show is this from?Parks and Recreation
This is fact. Mutts have never not been half amazing, half terrific. Its like they get all the best qualities from whatever breed made them up.Mutts are great, but sometimes they get all the worst qualities. Sometimes they just get a random grab bag of the two parents qualities, good and bad.		That's why people like pure breeds. It's a consistent set of qualities dog after dog. If I love having a beagle or labrador retriever, when it comes time to get a new dog I can get one of those and get one that's pretty close to my old dog in terms of health problems, general energy and disposition, etc.
I'm lost. Isn't that Rob Lowe? Chris Traeger is the character Rob Lowe plays on the tv show Parks and Recreation
Chris Traeger is cool but his positivity is a bit un-human and weird. I like wholesome meme's vibe betterHe's the type of person that is great as an individual but if everyone acted so chipper all the time it'd be really odd. 
Tbh that's a motto more of us should adopt. She was crying, so I helped. You see a problem, you try to help. That's all. A lot of people hate being talked to/disturbed when they are crying. I do personally, because I'm embarrassed that someone noticed I was upset. So I don't console people, because I'm worried that I'd upset them by trying to intervene.
Tbh that's a motto more of us should adopt. She was crying, so I helped. You see a problem, you try to help.

If we had more free time and werent always in a rush or on such strict schedules I think most people would have this mind set.		It can be hard to help others when you need to dedicate most of your time just to the upkeep of your own life.

they're too mean to him it makes me sadI think the point about jerry is that he's made fun of all the time yet he's married to a super model, has great kids and a happy family, lives comfortably, has a huge penis, becomes a successful mayor, and lives till a hundred and something. Objectively almost anyone would kill to have his life. 
That's because outside of work, he's going home to his beautiful wife and daughters, and has tons of great friends and many talents! He's fine with the unwholesome work environment because everyone in his personal life is so great.And he has the biggest penis like, ever. 
more than once, no?	She thought they were dating... twice.
I want to meet this guyHe wants to meet you too and befriend you and tell you all types of things he loves about ducks and donkeys that has nothing to do with anything untoward and then ask if you'd like to go on a jog tomorrow morning.		It's really kind of oddly refreshing how friendly he is.

Mutts are great, but sometimes they get all the worst qualities. Sometimes they just get a random grab bag of the two parents qualities, good and bad.		That's why people like pure breeds.

If I love having a beagle or labrador retriever, when it comes time to get a new dog I can get one of those and get one that's pretty close to my old dog in terms of health problems, general energy and disposition, etc.No way in my experience,  all my pure breds have ended up with typical disorders. Hip problems for Alsatians,  head problems for cavalier king charles,  even my jack Russell terrier had a digestive problem that made her this ball of muscle because she couldn't po rocess fat properly (or something like that,  i was 13) and had to be on medication. 		Then i got a bitsa and she has lived 3 times as long and in perfect health!  She's currently 14 :-) 		But I'm very glad your experience was different and you had happy doggos! 
A lot of people hate being talked to/disturbed when they are crying. I do personally, because I'm embarrassed that someone noticed I was upset. So I don't console people, because I'm worried that I'd upset them by trying to intervene.Same. For this reason I almost never get very upset in public, it just feels embarrassing. 
I think many people probably would, but at least in America, it just seems everyone is hurting for time, all the time. If we had more free time and werent always in a rush or on such strict schedules I think most people would have this mind set.		It can be hard to help others when you need to dedicate most of your time just to the upkeep of your own life.Its not just time we also live in an age where being wrong can lead to mass public humiliation. A lot of people just don't want to risk getting involved in other peoples problems for fear of being wrong about their assumption.

My girlfriend just broke up with me last night.. Right before Valentines Day..Step 1: Return gift			Step 2: Google "Anti-Valentine's Day parties" in your area, lots of clubs do this			Step 3: Use gift money to buy ticket/cover charge/alcohol			Step 4: Talk to the first girl you're attracted to in the club, if rejected proceed to the next, repeat as needed			Step 5: I think there's a rule against posting sexual content on this sub but you get the idea.			Good luck!
My girlfriend just broke up with me last night.. Right before Valentines Day..At least she didn't wait until Valentine's day so she gets a present then leaves you.		An ex of my friend did this to him. He was pissed.
My girlfriend just broke up with me last night.. Right before Valentines Day..I don't know if this will help, but I think of Valentine's Day as a negative holiday, regardless of whether I'm in a relationship or not, because of its tendency to make so many people feel left out and shitty. Good holidays can be celebrated by everybody. 		So this is only the second V-Day in over 20 years that I will be single for, so most of my life I've had someone I could have done V-Day things with. But I kept noticing how many people were sad on Valentine's Day because they had to spend it alone. And just now, seeing the comments here, there are a lot of people who Valentines Day just makes sad. And that makes me angry at it (yes, at the holiday, which isn't really logical) for being so exclusionary. It's such a mean, crappy holiday. 		Anyway, once I started feeling this way about it, I never wanted to celebrate it because I kept thinking about people who were feeling bad because of it and that took all the fun out of it. 		I don't mean to begrudge anyone their holiday celebration at all. Just trying to offer a perspective that might help someone who is feeling down about tomorrow to not feel so bad. 		Maybe we should celebrate Valentine's Day like elementary school kids. Everyone in the class gives out little paper cards to everyone else and if you're gonna give out cards, you have to give one to everyone.		TL: DR; In the anthropomorphic family of holidays, Valentine's Day is that mean jerk uncle who makes fun of little kids and makes them cry.

Nothing your gf does is because she hates/loves you. It is all something that she is going through herself. My advice would be to remove yourself from that communication, and know that it's for the better. Through your relationship you've found that you're capable of loving someone- and it'll happen again! Just focus on bringing something to the table for the next one;-) 			I apologize for the possible projection.		Much love
My gf of 4 years just left me, beat me, then slept with one of my friends this past weekend.  I need you guys right now.		edit: obligatory thanks for the gold stranger.  I love you guys, thank you all for being there for me.  I really, really needed it and you guys showed up for me.  This has always been my favorite sub but I rarely post, now it's miles ahead of any other sub.Sorry, dude. You don't deserve that. You'll find someone better, believe you me.

I don't really have any useful experiences to help you with, but I do have a funny cat picture that might make you smile a little bit: 	[thirsty cat](http://imgur.com/j7E0SRP.jpg)		Be you, remember that it's okay to cry and that it's useful to talk about it (but also okay to wrap yourself in blankets and pretend you are a burrito). <3
We love you too! Hugs anyone? :)I can't hug.
Get your ass over here and let me hug you, goddamnitI want one too! :)
Yep. Even though nobody would ever love me romantically, it's nice to know that there are good wholesome people here. 		Edit: thanks for the kind words everyone Never say never, my friend.

Yep. Even though nobody would ever love me romantically, it's nice to know that there are good wholesome people here. 		Edit: thanks for the kind words everyone You are one of those good, wholesome people! Lemme tell you, I am (I've been told) a conventionally attractive female. I have a lot going for me and last night I was having a little bit of a cry/pity party because I had a feeling I would never find another relationship or someone to love me. I kept focusing on everything that's wrong with me. I'm telling you this to let you know that EVERYONE feels like you do at some point. Just remember that there is someone out there for you. Someone is currently searching for your exact brand of being. It's only a matter of time before you find them. So, while you're waiting, do things you enjoy. Cultivate hobbies. Someone is bound to see you doing what you love and want to get in on the action with you.

Also if you DO have a date, you are also loved. :)This is going to be my first ever Valentine's Day where I'm not single!! I love you guys too :)
At the age of 21, I'm actually going on my very first date tonight! 		Thank you /r/wholesomememes for making me a happier person.Enjoy your date, friend, I'm excited for you!
my bottle of bottom-shelf whiskey is my Valentine's dateThat sounds like a night! Make sure to keep hydrated to avoid hangovers!!
Will you all be my valentine?  :)Absolutely!

My ex called me at 230am and kept me on the phone the until 7am! 7. A. M. W. T. F. And she pretty much just said she was moving on and that she was going to start dating again. We will survive!I know it might hurt right now but this is the best possible outcome. Obviously it wasn't working between you two (for whatever reason) and if you both stuck with it you would have been unhappy. The heartache would have only been worse. 		As hard as it is you have to get in the mindset of thinking 'I wish you the best, I hope you're happy' so you can, for the most part, get her out of your head and focus on yourself. It's normal to remember the good moments but don't dwell on them. When you're ready to get back out there I promise you there is a beautiful lady just waiting for you to strike up a conversation and maybe start something new. If you strike out a few times don't give up. As long as you don't give up you will eventually meet someone who makes you feel like the best you possible and vise versa. 		I wish you the best my dude! I'm rooting for you!! 
I'm so sorry :( you're a good person and I care about your wellbeing. It'll be ok.thank you <3
I'm so sorry :( you're a good person and I care about your wellbeing. It'll be ok.I've never seen such positivity on Reddit. Is this wholesomeness a meme in itself?
I'm so sorry :( you're a good person and I care about your wellbeing. It'll be ok.shh bby is okay.
I'm in a weird position too. I broke up with my girl last night but it's been a terrible few weeks with arguing and bad behavior towards each other. I feel so empty and alone.Empty and alone is the feeling you get when you end something, it's that brief moment when you let all the bad go out of your body and it is now easy for you to fill it back up with happiness. 		Edit: grammar
I'm in a weird position too. I broke up with my girl last night but it's been a terrible few weeks with arguing and bad behavior towards each other. I feel so empty and alone.You're not alone. I just sent a hug through my screen to you, hope you got it! If not let me know and I'll send another one, hugs sometimes get lost but that's cool :)
Step 1: Return gift			Step 2: Google "Anti-Valentine's Day parties" in your area, lots of clubs do this			Step 3: Use gift money to buy ticket/cover charge/alcohol			Step 4: Talk to the first girl you're attracted to in the club, if rejected proceed to the next, repeat as needed			Step 5: I think there's a rule against posting sexual content on this sub but you get the idea.			Good luck!If anyone is near Seattle and in need of a valentine, check out the Seattle Aquarium at noon tomorrow!		They are sending their two octopi on a blind date. I don't have a valentine but imma go to that because it sounds f'ning adorable. I wonder if they'll hold all eight of their little octopussy hands :') 
At least she didn't wait until Valentine's day so she gets a present then leaves you.		An ex of my friend did this to him. He was pissed.An ex did this to me on Christmas. 30 minutes after she unwrapped all her presents she ended it. I could never be so heartless. 
Don't worry man, just be thankful you aren't in /r/incels right now.That place is the opposite of wholesome, yeah I've not gotten laid in years and I wish I was getting but yeesh, human rights are a thing for a reason!
Brilliant. I'll bring my cat and some cookies. Will there be cuddles?

She isn't considering anyone but herself right now, maybe that's what she needs, but it hurts so much that she has to express it painful ways to me.  She's picking up the rest of her crap on Wednesday (I won't be there) and then I plan on deleting her number.  She's only moving a few blocks and we have the same friend group so it'll be hard but I'm already feeling better than yesterday.  Panic attacks that last 6 hours aren't very fun
Sorry, dude. You don't deserve that. You'll find someone better, believe you me. Thanks.  I just want to be ok on my own at this point.  Surprised I could be such a bad judge of character after 4 years.
I can't hug.Mental hugs! Virtual hugs! ALL THE HUGS!

It's been 4 months of empty and alone for me :(That's alright. People heal at different speeds. It won't be forever. You're going to find some thing or someone who's going to shine like the sun to your eyes. It could be a hobby, it could be a best friend, it could be a new sweetheart. Once you find it you'll feel more fulfilled than you ever had before, and even if it passes that light will always be a part of you, all the people who have made you feel that way are, even if it's hard to see right now.		The important part is to never stop looking.

I'm single and was sad for a reeeeallly long time until I discovered a new hobby I love, an old hobby I had neglected and realized I'm pretty awesome all by myself. Now if a love interest comes along, I think I will be much more emotionally stable and able to love better, but if it doesn't, I'm not sweating it cause I'm happy with me.

I tend to think about these kinds of things in a way that is both highly uncharitable to myself (mainly that I'm subconsciously doing it for appearances or to assuage a subconscious guilt for being awful) and at the same time self-centered.

wholesome people at the skate parkWell, now I go into this job interview with tears in my eyes. 		Edit: since you are all so supportive, I got the job! It's a non-profit organization where I'd be helping those with mental disabilities get to and from work, and help them with their jobs! 		Also, since it's a nonprofit, my federal student loans are forgiven after 10 years! 
wholesome people at the skate parkAs someone who just started "skating" (going from point A to point B on a $30 Penny board), I can verify that the skating community is very nice. It gets too much of a bad rap in media, ect. 		Ex: I was skating a bit and was about to pass someone else who was carrying a board while talking to his friend. He saw me and put his fist out as I rode past. I met his fist-bump and kept going.		I don't know who you are random fist-bump person, but that actually made my day.

wholesome people at the skate parkI used to be the little kid at the skate park (a good 10 years back) and all I remember is that the ppl there were, despite being in trouble w/ the law and using drugs, the nicest ppl I had met.	The main thing that's stuck w/ me all this time is that, just cos someone could be addicted drugs, in trouble w/ the law or homeless, anyone can be an incredibly sincere, kind person.
wholesome people at the skate parkI find it distressing that they saw a Sk8ter Boi and immediately prepared to say "see you later boy".
wholesome people at the skate parkReminds me of the Braille skate guys https://m.youtube.com/user/sprocker7 there is kids in most of their videos. Thinking back, my local skate park was a bunch of kids from 8-17 with some adults hanging out with their younger siblings/ friends whatever'. Always felt welcome there even with the age gap.
wholesome people at the skate parkMan I hate when it starts raining indoors. My fat cheeks keep getting wet. 
wholesome people at the skate parkThat teenager's name? Albert Einstein.

Oh I remember this! The kid was older (I think 17-20) and he actually worked as a skate instructor!!I don't know if this makes it more or less wholesome. I would like to think that it was just some teenager who had to do something out of the norm to help this little girl. But at the same time I'm glad that he is an instructor and knows how to best help the girl grow
Oh I remember this! The kid was older (I think 17-20) and he actually worked as a skate instructor!!This happened in my area

I love this, as a part of the skateboarding community, this is a *very* wholesome meme.Skaters were pretty cool with everyone that I remember. It's weird cause they messed with people too but wasn't ever anything violent. Just weird shit like chewing crackers and pretending to vomit near you. 
I love this, as a part of the skateboarding community, this is a *very* wholesome meme.I love the skateboarders in my area. I am an amateur photographer and I suck at action shots. When I go to the park and tell them I need practice taking pictures they are always willing and will make an  effort to help me get the shot. 		I go to my friend's son's soccer game I need to explain who I am and what I am doing there.		Edit: changed for clarity

It's a non-profit organization where I'd be helping those with mental disabilities get to and from work, and help them with their jobs! 		Also, since it's a nonprofit, my federal student loans are forgiven after 10 years! Good luck for your job interview! I hope it's something you'll enjoy to do!
Here is a link to the original story, I wanted to know more so I looked it up. 		https://www.google.ca/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3282817?client=safari		I'd stay away from the comments section, though. Not nearly as wholesome.
Wow, Men are great mentors.They definitely can be :)
I don't know if this makes it more or less wholesome. I would like to think that it was just some teenager who had to do something out of the norm to help this little girl. But at the same time I'm glad that he is an instructor and knows how to best help the girl growMore wholesome. As an instructor, he didn't try to charge for his time or convince her to take lessons with him - he just wanted to help.

Lets all take a moment to appreciate our teachers that actually try!

Even the biggest scallys would be lovely to kids - think they are mostly just keen to grow the sport and remember what it was like at first. The only exception is when they put themselves/other users at danger but only ever saw arguments with the parents in that regard.

He looked just like all of the other "older boys" but he made her feel safe and welcome so she's no longer afraid to go to the skate park. 
Do you have a source? This was the cutest thing ever.>It turns out that the teenage boy is actually a 20-year-old avid skateboarder and coach, Ryan Carney, who played down his good deed and just did what felt natural, according to the Cambridge Times.

Thanks for sharing! I didn't believe the post at all because "what fifteen year old boy wears khakis to a skate park?" and thought it was fake. Even though the details are different it's still wholesome :)Khakis are pretty popular with skaters. 
It's amazing the difference one person can make :)And a reminder that even small, seemingly inconsequential, actions can have a profound impact.
Makes me miss my high school skating days. We had a really great skate community back in my hometown those daysYeah... The only ones we were really dicks to were the BMX kids in the skatepark. 
This is so punk rock.		Like actually punk.Why do people say this.
Skaters were pretty cool with everyone that I remember. It's weird cause they messed with people too but wasn't ever anything violent. Just weird shit like chewing crackers and pretending to vomit near you. Hahahah shit why was that a thing?? I just remember adding a little gargled cola really gave it that authentic look.
I love the skateboarders in my area. I am an amateur photographer and I suck at action shots. When I go to the park and tell them I need practice taking pictures they are always willing and will make an  effort to help me get the shot. 		I go to my friend's son's soccer game I need to explain who I am and what I am doing there.		Edit: changed for clarityCameras are ingrained in the skateboard community and generally the kids are by themselves. Soccer parents are usually always with their kids and aren't used to cameras being present. As a former skate boarder I'd have been stoked if someone wanted to take cool pictures of me unsuccessfully attempting a 360 flip. I could nollie like nobodies business though. 
The only part of this that doesn't fly is his friends "making fun of him."  I can't imagine any skaters at a park being negative about a friend helping a kid out.I would assume his friends were play-making fun of him, and the mom interpreted it as the real thing.
And with this I can put down my phone and get started with my day having faith humanity is not completely gone. Nowadays I wonder. It used to be the internet would sap my faith in humanity over weeks, and I would need to get it restored every month or so.		Now, this subreddit is like constant maintenance for the soul.
Skate community can be one of the most wholesome places The local skatepark helped me plenty when i was in high schook. If i couldnt find a plug, i always could rely on someone from the park to hook a couple Gs of mid. It was nice
Can confirm, am scary looking teen. Can you mentor me then?
It's a really great place to visit if you need a pick me up.Whenever I feel too much weight on my shoulders or just need an emotional pick-me-up this is the first place I come (assuming I'm not around my wife or kids).
I always loved skate culture, but was never good at skateboarding so I gave it up (never had those supportive people around where I was when I was ~10). As a 23 year old, how hard would it be to get to a functional skating level? 		I've only been thinking about it recently cause I've been playing skate 3 daily since it became backwards compatible Don't even trip bro, you can start skating at any age. It would probably take a good month to become fully comfortable riding your board. You're definitely gonna want to get the basics like kickturn and stopping down. Get used to picking up your board by slapping the tail down because this will prep you for your ollies (I'm assuming you haven't learned them yet).		Another month to learn how to ollie. There's a million how-to videos, so you got this  But a personal tip from me would be to think of it like a normal jump, except instead of jumping with both feet, you're jumping off one foot and the other follows shortly after. Like a teeter-totter motion. The important part is slapping that tail down fast, not hard. This takes a lot of ankle power. A lot of people will tell you to focus on sliding your front foot up the board, but if you're learning the ollie don't do that... It will just confuse and frustrate you. The main focus should be slapping that tail down as fast and as hard as you can to lift the board off the ground, and if you just do that teeter-totter motion like I mentioned, your front foot will naturally slide up. After you feel like you've got a solid foundation, THEN you can start focusing on sliding your front foot and boning your ollies. It'll be much easier this way. Just remember, it's just a normal jump, but on a skateboard (and you're popping that tail down fast).		Another month to learn how to ollie over things. Once you feel super confident with your ollies while moving, then this becomes trivial. After this go for the BS 180, then FS 180. Do an ollie like normal, except now you're turning your shoulders and head to the direction you want to spin. You need to put A LOT of force to actually do a full rotation, and it's not hard - it just takes a lot of guts and commitment. Half of the work is in turning your upper body, the other half is doing an ollie and making the board turn with your legs. Again, a million videos on this.		From there on, you can start learning other flip tricks or you can try skating in bowls or half pipes. Whatever suits you. All the stuff I mentioned above is just the basics for maneuvering, which will come in handy when you're skating through a city or park or something.

That's why I love skateboarding. I can be just as excited to see a 10 year old land their first kickflip cause we can all remember how it felt. Me being able to do harder tricks does nothing to negate your sense of accomplishment of learning a new trick, and vice versa. We've all been that little girl in the past, and we all look to pay it forward (most of us anyways)If anything that first kick flip felt better than nailing any tricks afterwards because it was the first time you ever accomplished something seemingly impossible on a skateboard. It's a little high that we all chase

Man, you've been a positive influence on me today. 		I'm a single father of two young girls and lately, I've been worried about the world I'm giving to them. Posts like yours remind me that things can and will get better because of good people like you and me.		So thanks.Thank you so much for taking the time to say this! It really means a lot to me. And from your post, I can guess that you're doing a good job of raising your girls. Even if you make mistakes, we all do, and they'll appreciate you being honest with them and yourself more than they would appreciate you being a "perfect" person. Keep being you!

Yeah... The only ones we were really dicks to were the BMX kids in the skatepark. to be fair, our park's concrete was only graded for skateboard use, bmx tires were actually bad for the concrete. so we had to be dicks to them... for the sake of self-preservation

What's the opposite of gatekeeping? Gateopening? What great advice! 		I'm a middle aged lady now, but I remember learning when I was a teenager. I had so much fun on the board, despite never learning to ollie (my friends said that my hand me down board didn't have enough "pop.") It was just a shame that I broke my ankle (at a concert) so soon into my skating, that I wasn't able to pick it back up. My ankle would swell up and there was no skating anymore. 		But people like you are who made learning to skate, and just skating around fun.

Exactly! And that just shows that he also happens gets paid to do what he obviously loves doing.I hit up my skatepark every summer and there's always the teenagers who think they own the park. I've helped out a fair few kids who are super eager to skate but are all over the shop and in danger of cutting someone up and causing an accident. This one kid was so chatty and eager despite having a 20 board and struggling to control it. He was having way more fun than the older skaters. I'd much rather skate with a kid who is over the moon that he didn't fall off or learned how to kickturn than skate with the older kids who take the piss constantly and think less of someone for doing a sloppy tre flip. I know they can't help it because they're teenagers and it's what they do. Nowadays I end up chatting more to the parents who are bringing their kids to the park for the first time and try to make the skatepark seem less intimidating. Everyone's welcome, everyone should feel they can have a go without fear of the pot smoking teenagers taking the piss.		I actually worked in a skatepark for a year and still try to skate now and then, despite being 31 and gaining weight while losing tricks. Working at a skatepark is great but you can't support a family and pay a mortgage on it. I'm kinda resigned to my office job and only skating a few nights a month during the summer. My son's gonna be old enough to give it a go soon. Looking forward to teaching him the ropes.

That was a hard time! 		Thankfully, I ended up pursuing snowboarding and had a great time with my team and coaches in high school. Those guys really helped me grow and love the sport!		I really love the general trend of 'do what makes you happy' over 'do what your gender should'.  For young girls *and* boys.

I don't have a problem with scooters specifically but the ones who just stand in the middle of the park doing nothing bother me quite a bit. I've had mixed experiences with scooter kids. I'm an older-ish (30 next month) skater who hasn't frequented too many parks in recent memory. However what I remember from my few times sharing a park with scooters is this:		They're cool ass kids who are usually very respectful in a general sense. However, I think the problem is that scootering (actual word?) hasn't been entrenched in skate park culture long enough for most of them to understand basic skate park protocols. They didn't pay attention to things like line ups or really care to pay attention if they got blatantly in the way with somebody obviously doing a specific run. 		I think it's an issue that will resolve itself as scooter folks spend more and more time in skate park culture.		Like I said though: their general civility didn't go unnoticed. They just need to brush up on the specifics of the culture they are relatively new to.		That being said: shred on little dudes and please keep an open mind if one of us old woodpushers try giving you some advice on the mechanics of the culture :) 		Edit: I dnt spell or grammer good

We feed them, we love them, we show emotion  in front of them and they don't even speak English and all they do in return is love back. 		But this assumption that we don't deserve dogs is just going too far. Nobody talks about the accidental peeing or popping in the house, or the ripped up rug, or the chewed up remote or the puddle of throw up. 		It's a mutually beneficial relationship.

Well we made them the way they are on purpose, to fit our wantsIt's commonly thought that as much as humans domesticated dogs, they also domesticated themselves. Some of the more tame wolves started approaching closer and closer to humans as there were typically scraps of food around after hunts. The friendlier wolves found that by not eating weak/young humans, they were not attacked. The early humans saw that the wolves could be used as a very helpful tool on hunts and they could catch more meat and finish hunts faster than by themselves.		Our two species have adapted to each other as companions. Dogs are phenomenal at reading the facial expressions and cues of humans and do so on an instinctual level. One of the many reasons, and perhaps one of the most important, that humans and proto-dogs got along so well was that they have a pack mentality and are eager to fulfill their role in the group. They are easy to train and are relatively close to humans in being fantastic long distance runners.		Plus, they're adorable.

Eugenics are not v wholesomeAs I understand it, the main problems with eugenics are, from most awful to least:		1. It usually involves using pseudoscience to support racial discrimination, and it's very easy for that sort of thing to slip in.		2. It requires violating people's bodily autonomy, which is a huge no-no in terms of human rights.		3. Natural selection is really, really bad at doing what it does. Human artifical selection can do better, but it might still take generations of constant work (and consistent widespread support) to notice even minor improvements. Possibly dozens, or even hundreds of generations.

Fun AND informative I read this in Chris Traeger's voice!
they didnt domesticate themselves they probably had no other choice tbh		think of humans.The very idea of choice is pretty much a human construct. For most of nature it's all about doing whatever makes life easiest/least likely to die.		Think of those fish that basically live to clean the food out of shark's teeth. They didn't choose that role in any meaningful way other than how it was a path of survival.		I know that dogs make choices in their lives. But so much of that is because we have made their lives easier and more free so that they can afford to make choices that aren't directly tied to food and sex.
Do you have a single piece of evidence for this assertion?		>It's commonly thought that as much as humans domesticated dogs, they also domesticated themselves		This sounds nice but there is no evidence for it at all.

Heneeda to be carried up and down stairs or it takes him ages and he strugglesI never have the opportunity to tell anyone this cool story from my childhood... so yea, Imma use this opportunity lol		When I was a kid I had a little male Chihuahua and another much bigger collie/mut mix that stayed outside. Their pen was essentially one large wire enclosure with a divider in the center. They mainly stayed running around in the yard during the days but would put them in their homes when the sun went down. 		Like real children, sometimes they would be all "like, totally coo you guys" about putting them in their pens at night... but sometimes they would protest the decision, adamantly, and absolutely vocalize to me how much they did not agree with my decision.		Anywho... The next morning I went out to feed, water, and let the doggies out for the day. I routinely started with the Chihuahua first since he was a lot easier to handle than the continuously jumping, drooling, barking, total spaz of a dog that the other collie mix was. lol.		I got to the chihuahua's door, look down, and see the little motherfucker lookin exactly like the pedophiles dog that drags its legs on Family Guy! He was as excited as EVER. Completely looking and acting normal as hell like they have always been like that. Absolutely NO signs of distress. Hell, he looked as if he didn't even notice his legs not working. My mind was truly in the BOGGLE'N stage of function. And let me tell ya... he was fucking BOOKING it. Running all around that damn pen... almost as if to taunt whoever this "God"  guy was that takes away from his "Human Time" that all the humans have been talking about.		Still to this day I have no idea what happened to him... but from the looks of the pen my best theory is that he dug a hole under the dividing fence trying to go visit his friend on the other side and while he was half way to the other side... the big brute of a collie dog started jumping in excitement and landed on his back.   		Sooo yea. Took him to the vet and uhhhhh... YUP. Looks like his back is somewhat broke or fractured or something. I was a kid so I honestly don't remember anything about what the vet said... but I DO remember that they had to do some surgery on the little guy and that WE would have to put him through physical therapy afterwards. 		SO... he had the surgery. It went great and then we took him home to start the stringent physical therapy schedule. How did we do this? 		We filled up a medium sized ice cooler/chest with water and about 2 to 3 times a day we would hold him up in the cooler with his back legs in the water and manually move his legs as if he was walking in order to build the leg muscles again and help bring back his muscle memory.		We also had this medicated cream from the vet that we had to constantly apply where and when needed... and apart from the actual walking aspect... the other very major aspect of his recovery was constantly dressing his wounds due to him dragging his legs around (This was before I even thought about doggy wheelchair devices or knew they existed. lol. I felt so sorry for him because the part that rubbed the most was his lil ball sack and I constantly had to apply cream on them and keep him wrapped in gauze or whatever to try to counter all the rubbing.		It took about a month or 2 of doing this and seeing improvements little by little but we FINALLY got him rehabilitated and walking again. It's these types of little things that make me extremely happy and put a smile on my face. 		   **TL;DR: My childhood pet Chihuahua crippled his back legs, had to have surgery, and I put him through physical therapy for months until he regained his strength and started walking again.**

Completely looking and acting normal as hell like they have always been like that. Absolutely NO signs of distress. Hell, he looked as if he didn't even notice his legs not working. My mind was truly in the BOGGLE'N stage of function. And let me tell ya... he was fucking BOOKING it. Running all around that damn pen... almost as if to taunt whoever this "God"  guy was that takes away from his "Human Time" that all the humans have been talking about.		Still to this day I have no idea what happened to him... but from the looks of the pen my best theory is that he dug a hole under the dividing fence trying to go visit his friend on the other side and while he was half way to the other side... the big brute of a collie dog started jumping in excitement and landed on his back.   		Sooo yea. Took him to the vet and uhhhhh... YUP. Looks like his back is somewhat broke or fractured or something. I was a kid so I honestly don't remember anything about what the vet said... but I DO remember that they had to do some surgery on the little guy and that WE would have to put him through physical therapy afterwards. 		SO... he had the surgery. It went great and then we took him home to start the stringent physical therapy schedule. How did we do this? 		We filled up a medium sized ice cooler/chest with water and about 2 to 3 times a day we would hold him up in the cooler with his back legs in the water and manually move his legs as if he was walking in order to build the leg muscles again and help bring back his muscle memory.		We also had this medicated cream from the vet that we had to constantly apply where and when needed... and apart from the actual walking aspect... the other very major aspect of his recovery was constantly dressing his wounds due to him dragging his legs around (This was before I even thought about doggy wheelchair devices or knew they existed. lol. I felt so sorry for him because the part that rubbed the most was his lil ball sack and I constantly had to apply cream on them and keep him wrapped in gauze or whatever to try to counter all the rubbing.		It took about a month or 2 of doing this and seeing improvements little by little but we FINALLY got him rehabilitated and walking again. It's these types of little things that make me extremely happy and put a smile on my face. 		   **TL;DR: My childhood pet Chihuahua crippled his back legs, had to have surgery, and I put him through physical therapy for months until he regained his strength and started walking again.**This made me smile so much! The love and dedication to that dog you had is so adorable.

Wholesome artI am legally blind. My vision is 20/400. That means that you can see something 20 feet away that I have to be 1 foot away to see it. I wanted to go to college for art, because I've always loved to draw and I love to learn. The student counselor urged me to pick a different degree. I calmly told him I had made up my mind. The art history teacher told me he didn't think I would be able to analyze famous paintings in any meaningful way. I showed him a small telescopic device I used and described the painting he was using as an example in exhaustive detail. I told him to grade me the same as anyone else. (I ended up getting As in both classes I took from him, plus he kept a paper I wrote on the Greek statute Discupolis to read to future classes.). The advanced drawing teacher told me she felt it was wrong for me to be in her class because my best work would be inferior to other students average work. Drawing classes always put people's work up on the wall grouped by how good it is. It soon became apparent that I was one of the best in the class. I finally got my associates degree in Fine Arts. With Higher Honors. I also got a certificate degree in graphic design. It's one of the things I'm most proud of in my life. Several experts tried to say I couldn't be an artist. I excelled in spite of them.		TL;DR college professors told me a blind person would fail out of an Art degree. I showed everyone otherwise.

Does anyone have any kind of proof that Bill Nye is a dick? Sounds like a petty rumor a climate change denier or anti-vaxxer would make up. I only see hearsay.Well, isn't the very nature of celebrities' true nature when interacting with fans that it is inherently hearsay? I mean, the premises of someone like Nye being rude is testimony from people who have met him. It is inherently hearsay.		The question is, does it continue to be hearsay when dozens of people, maybe hundreds come out and say they've also had unsavory experiences with him? I think at that point it's more than just rumours.

Pretty much everyone who I spoke to that met him at the conference said it was a disappointing experience (except for the pretty girls).		Jerk is perhaps too strong a word, but he sure isn't the persona you see from his show.  I'd probably go with impatient and sarcastic based on the interactions I saw from across the room...

There are so few truly great people in the world that I can't really go out and get mad at someone who is just as flawed as half the people I run into every day.

Context for non-Americans?On the left is Fred Rogers, and on the right is Bill Nye. A lot of Americans watched "Mr. Roger's Neighborhood" growing up, and Mr. Rogers was known for being very friendly and genuine. Bill Nye's show was called "Bill Nye the Science Guy," and his show was shown in almost every science class before middle school. In addition, reddit loves Bill Nye today, because he gives talks on climate change.		So they're two television stars that we remember from our childhood.

You should move the a=a-1 to just after "Take one down, pass it around"
Who are these people?Fred Rogers and Bill Nye. 
Who are these people?They both hosted educational television programs in the US. Mr Rogers focused on very young children, about three to six, and talked about using your imagination, random interesting things like how crayons are made, and how we're all lovable just the way we are. He was an accomplished musician and a Christian minister. His speech to Congress back in the... (80's?) is pretty much why the US still has a public television station funded with federal taxes. His show shaped generations of Americans. The first few seasons are in black in white, and he kept making new ones until at least the nineties and maybe into the 2000's. He is no longer living. 		Bill Nye is stand up comedian turned science educator. His show was geared toward a slightly older audience, roughly nine to fourteen. He talked about basic science concepts such as simple machines, natural selection, and electricity. His show had a much shorter run, mostly in the nineties iirc. Compared to the calm sweet grandpa of Rogers, Nye is your crazy uncle who will blow shit up with you in the backyard. He now tries to do basic science education to Fox News anchors and debates religious nuts. 		This all off the top of my head, details may be slightly off.
Bill Nye wants to jail people who are skeptical of climate change. I didn't know fascism was wholesome.Actually, if you watch that interview with him, what he says is that he can understand why some people feel that people who are in positions of power who are using denying climate change as a way to make money should be held accountable for their actions.		He does not at any point say that he personally feels that way, and he especially doesn't say that denying climate change should be a crime.		All he actually says, in so far as his stance on the matter, is that people who let their companies do things that are likely to further damage our climate, are effecting the quality of life of everyone else on the planet.

That's just an unfortunate rumor. Everyone I've heard from that's met him says he's a very nice person.

Most of the stories I'm finding of him "being an asshole" boil down to either:		1. People asking him for autographs, which he doesn't like to do (and isn't obligated to do)		2. Bill getting shitty with people who won't listen when he tries to explain something science-related, or who continue arguing with basic facts		3. Unsubstantiated stories of Bill acting completely out of character (getting drunk and desperately trying to pick up women, acting like a diva backstage, etc.).

But that doesn't negate the voluminous amounts of first person accounts of how much of a jerk Bill Nye can be at times.		To your points:		* Sure, a celebrity isn't required to sign autographs, but they can politely decline to do so without coming off as an asshat.	* Being shitty to other people, for whatever reason, supports the notion that Bill can be a jerk toward people under other circumstances.	* Acting out of character compared to what? Compared to your impression of him? When there are so many accounts of him being an asshole, at some point don't you think that it's potentially true that that's the way he behaves (at times) and that it's not a worldwide conspiracy to smear his name?

Well, isn't the very nature of celebrities' true nature when interacting with fans that it is inherently hearsay?

The question is, does it continue to be hearsay when dozens of people, maybe hundreds come out and say they've also had unsavory experiences with him? I think at that point it's more than just rumours.Firsthand reports of a person being rude to them is not hearsay, it's anecdotal evidence.

A young child in the audience asked him what his favourite book was- when he responded he asked the little boy to come up on stage with him so he could talk with him more one-on-one. While answering, I wish I could remember what book he said, he gave the boy the copy of the book he read to the audience. It was quite touching.

Yeah I've been struggling to come to terms with this since I found out about it and I've found the solution I think:		Bill Nye the person *may* be an asshole but Bill Nye the Science Guy was not. BNtSG is a character, and the character is who I will shift my adoration to *if the stories are true*. If they aren't, there's no issue.		Moreover, even *if* Bill Nye is a jerk, that doesn't in any way diminish his contribution to teaching children about science. The work he's done is definitely worth praise, especially nowadays when science education is sorely lacking. I'm not gonna turn my nose up to someone willing to educate people and kids in a fun and engaging way just because he may be an asshole off camera.  I've never seen a solid source for these "Bill Nye is an asshole" stories.

Sure he is. Kids from all across the country got energized and excited about science. He was the highlight of any class period. The best thing your teacher could do was wheel in the TV and pop in Bill Nye. Everyone chanting "BILL BILL BILL". It's unfortunate some people had unpleasant experiences in person, things happen that we may not see or understand. But those negative experiences represent .01% of all interactions we've had with Bill. The rest are like I described above. So I think he's just as influential and wholesome.It's just some people that are political partisans that are butthurt that Bill calls out fatuous claims as fatuous.		Don't worry about these people.
This is true, there was a thread on the worst celebs people have met and there a were a lot of stories about how unpleasant he was.My dad is a pretty science-y and machine type dude and he often just doesn't get how to interact with others. When he's talking about how something works, he's really animated, but you can tell he gets pretty frustrated pretty quickly in social situations.

But I'm not advocating for the "Bill's a saint" position really, just that many of the stories about him being mean seem either explainable or outlandish based on how he seems to act in professional settings (interviews, talks at universities, etc - when he's not on TV to act a part). He could be a terrible person, I guess, but nothing about his professional character seems to suggest it to me, and I know he holds views that would be consistent with having a thoughtful, intelligent, and caring personality.

I think the stories probably always existed. I mean, if you meet hundreds of people a year, not everybodies going to walk away happy about it. People can interpret things as being mean and rude when they're really not meant to be, especially when they have expectations that might not be realistic.		I think the difference is that once he became viewed as more of a political figure, the stories that existed just got a little more legs on them, and perhaps got emphasized a little more negatively.

Gigantic if correct.Sizable if factual
Nothings wrong, he just sorta acts like he is a scientist, which he is not Why isn't he a scientist? An engineering degree requires a background in science and math. Are you saying that engineers don't practice science? The only difference between science and engineering degrees are that engineers are licensed to build things and that scientists focus a bit more on theoretical stuff, and observation. To say that they aren't closely related is disingenuous. And to say that an engineering degree doesn't allow someone to be a science teacher means you really don't understand how closely related they are. A chemistry degree and a chemical engineering share the same classes for the first two and a half years of school, for instance. They switch their focus a bit at the end of the program, but they are so closely related that someone walking out of the school with either degree could probably function fine at majority of the same jobs out of school, though the engineer would know more about heat transfer and pumps, while the chemist would know more about biochemistry and practical lab work.  		
There is a video floating around of him taking a tour with some iconic religious guy around a anti-science museum that made a lot of broad claims using poor reasoning about things like Global Warming, and the earth's age.		During that video, he was very condescending towards the person giving him the tour. I totally agreed he was being a dick, but a dick to someone who probably deserved it by spreading false information.You mean Ken Ham?  The guy who made a museum that would almost deliberately misinform anyone who attended it?  A museum based on the Bible and little to no science at all?  A museum that claims humans and dinosaurs coexisted, when scientific evidence claims otherwise?		I'd say Bill was completely justified in that regard.
Only 48% of people believe climate change is caused by human activities. We should jail the other 52%?		http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/public-views-on-climate-change-and-climate-scientists/I think he's suggesting that we prosecute people who intentionally misled the public about the reality of climate change for financial gain. I think that might be a difficult thing to do and a difficult case to make, especially in the current political climate, but I don't disagree with it in principle.

I'll look into it more.). Nye said this: "Was it appropriate to jail people from the cigarette industry who insisted that this addictive product was not addictive, and so on?".

Imagine if everything you knew about your dad came from one of the most beautiful and beloved TV shows ever created, dedicated to teach children to love all creatures.I think I might be in love with this subreddit. Goosebumps and happy tears for days. 
Seems likely. Off-camera he's not Bill Nye, he's Bill the fucking Boss. Im sure much of what he does has to do with the same agenda, he has something he's working to accomplish in life. There are deadlines to be made and time is on nobody's side. If you were tired doing your daily job as a crewmember just collecting a check, and you weren't really 'with' the big picture of things, I can see how Bill can come off as an asshole to you for not having your shit straight. Man probably runs a tight ship.It's like the people on Hell's Kitchen or Kitchen Nightmares who call Chef Ramsay an asshole. 		He's not. You're just a shitty cook and he doesn't have time for your bullshit because he's busy elevating.  		Replace cooking with science education for Nye.
I think it's more because of the stories they've heard about encounters people have had with him in public.Any of these from people that you actually know?
Which episode?1465, Mr. Rogers Goes to School
Looks like it's on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5i6nEVIHWY) too if you ever need it. I'm assuming she's the nice lady who drives the school bus?Yes, she was.
He actually has a new show coming to NetflixSeriously?! What's it about? I mean I could Google it but I have no friends and I like conversation
Sizable if factualElephantine, assuming legitimacy 
Why isn't he a scientist? An engineering degree requires a background in science and math. Are you saying that engineers don't practice science? The only difference between science and engineering degrees are that engineers are licensed to build things and that scientists focus a bit more on theoretical stuff, and observation. To say that they aren't closely related is disingenuous. And to say that an engineering degree doesn't allow someone to be a science teacher means you really don't understand how closely related they are. A chemistry degree and a chemical engineering share the same classes for the first two and a half years of school, for instance. They switch their focus a bit at the end of the program, but they are so closely related that someone walking out of the school with either degree could probably function fine at majority of the same jobs out of school, though the engineer would know more about heat transfer and pumps, while the chemist would know more about biochemistry and practical lab work.  		Engineers are not scientists the same way mechanics aren't engineers and computer scientists aren't developers. It's by the definition of the words themselves.		My Eli5 version of definitions:		* Scientists are people actively pursuing new information on a topic. This is a pure research position.		* Engineers design things to be built using scientific findings. This is an applied science position.		His main professions today are author, producer, and actor/host. You can say he's an ex engineer, and knowledgeable of science, but he's currently neither a scientist nor an engineer. It's semantics.

They are broken individuals. Any one putting down Mr. Roger's Neighborhood is a flawed individual and doesn't understand the needs of very young children. I'm not in the "give every kid a trophy" camp at all- children need to be taught the value of perseverance and the self-reward of a job well done. But not at 3 years old! 
>imagine having to convince Trump of the value of Mr Rogers.		This is probably more along his way of thinking:	https://youtu.be/29lmR_357rAOh my god that is the video I hate the most on the internet now.
>imagine having to convince Trump of the value of Mr Rogers.

I mean I get it, you can't accidently let kids think they're snowflakes, it'll be the end of the world. I just think Goebbels is reaching a bit to call Mr. Rogers evil.
>imagine having to convince Trump of the value of Mr Rogers.		This is probably more along his way of thinking:	https://youtu.be/29lmR_357rAThose fucking twat waffles realize that Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood started in 1968, right? So there was an entire generation that watched it before the so called "entitled generation" they are harping on? Why didn't his show effect them negatively? Why would two different groups exposed to the same thing be so different in their eyes? It's almost like it has nothing to do with a fucking children's program...
>imagine having to convince Trump of the value of Mr Rogers.		This is probably more along his way of thinking:	https://youtu.be/29lmR_357rAWords really can't express how angry I get when I hear stuff like this coming from the generation who makes me search their email for them.

It's easier to train them to do something than to stop doing something. So up can try teaching her to fetch a toy or something Indeed! I tried and tried to get her to NOT bark at people, it was completely useless; not even shaming worked and that is pretty much how far I am willing to go when it comes to "punishing" my dog... So, I gave up on that and instead I trained her to not bark as loud.. Now she just like breaths really hard, like IF she were to bark, but with much less sound.

They just want you to come back and cuddle with themActually in the den its a pecking order to my dog. So normally when 1 person is watching tv they sit on the right side of the couch. 1 person and doggo, he goes to the left, if my wife and I are there he gets in the middle or floor if its hot. Middle of the night by himself, he takes the right cause he's the master then. 		It gets much better. He doesn't acknowledge the couch rights of guests. So if I'm on the right and have a friend over sitting in the left, he thinks thats his god given spot. So he sits down right in front of them and just acts agitated. A Great Dane sitting in front of you is just a dog 8 inches from your face breathing on you.

I don't know who this comedian is (I'm generally pretty oblivious about these things though) but I'm happy this is a thing that happened. His teacher looks so happy and proud.The tonight show is often a stand ups big break. Johnson probably did the 	stand up circuit in clubs and bars for a few years before getting invited to the tonight show. From here, he'll probably have more opportunities to do bigger media appearances, as well as more high-profile stand up. That's why the tonight show is such a big deal for comedians, and why the teachers encouragement (prediction!) means so much. 		So you may hear more from him soon :)  
What a great guyNot sure who you're referring to, the comedian or the teacher, but both would be accurate. 		The teacher looks like the type to be an inspirational, all-around cool dude.

Is this what this subreddit is like? Everyone is so positive! I'm going to visit here more often :) Yes! Its awesome, and so are you. :)
I love this story.Yeah well I love you

He passed about ten years ago.   But, as another redditor said, maybe I should contact his family.If you could tell his family that would be really nice.  Someone once asked me if I was related to Mr. fishmouth (my dad).  We have a not too common last name.  I said, "Yeah he's my dad."  Then they started singing this song my dad taught them in 8th grade science class to remember how to classify animals.  He still remembered the song after 15 years.  I felt really proud of my dad in that moment.  He told me that my dad got him really excited about science.  It might mean a lot to his kids or widow to hear that he made such an impact on you.    
He passed about ten years ago.   But, as another redditor said, maybe I should contact his family.And then you'd be doing his family a service, in my experience families are always super welcoming to stories about their passed family members impacting people in positive ways.
He passed about ten years ago.   But, as another redditor said, maybe I should contact his family.You definitely should. 		My dad passed away a couple of months ago. He was a DJ. After he died, I got a bunch of messages from people telling me how influential he was to their careers, or how he had nurtured them and they owed their success to him. 		It meant the absolute world to me. I loved hearing that my dad had an impact on other people. 		I'm sure your teachers family would love hearing your story, too. 
Whoops. I didn't see where I wasYou should be nice to everyone everywhere, friendo. If you're only kind here it comes across as a little fake, you know? Wholesomeness should be encouraged in every aspect of your life. 
Apparently he killed his girlfriend in the same process.I don't understand that though, sounds like she was his biggest fan. 
Thankkss!Your welcome you awesome person!
He made fun of his height and then made a bunch of noises. How any of that is supposed to be funny is beyond me. I wasn't going to watch it because I'm lazy, but your attempt at sneering made him sound endearing. I watched it and enjoyed it. Thanks for the tip off.
It's always been cool to be kind! in the right measure

I love how the new trend of 2017 is wholesome memesSeriously. I see it mentioned all over reddit, and even when it's not, I've been in threads before where everyone is being SO KIND that I have to doublecheck that it's not /r/wholesomemes. The appreciation of the upvote now seems to recognize true kindness when it appears, and not just skill of snark, comeback or putdown. I love it, and didn't even know I needed it. I've noticed it's increased my time on reddit, and my contributions as well. Because now hey, all you people? TURNS OUT I LIKE YOU PEOPLE. 
Wholesomememes for President. r/wholesomememes for global unification and world peace.
Gonna be intense in 2018 when the rebound happensThat just means we'll have to work harder at balancing things out.		The fact that we would even want too should be  cause for happiness.

Military dude comes home to surprise his fatherThis is an awesome gif and the full video is really great too but the caption that loads under the gif clearly says he is returning from TEACHING in S. Korea and makes absolutely no mention of him being in the military. I cant' find anything on his youtube channel about being in the military either. We don't have to add false context to the joy of a parent seeing their child who has been away to make it nice, do we? 
Military dude comes home to surprise his fatherI used to be in JROTC before I left for the military. One of my instructors was the best men I've ever known, that I credit him with putting me in the military more than my father. He got cancer while I was overseas and I was only able to visit him once before he passed away. It was quick and painless and I glad his family got to have that at least.		This house, as well as this man, resemble him so much it brought memories flooding back. I wish he was still alive to see how much influence he had on people, his family, and friends. All those students he was able to help. I learned so much from this man. 		RIP Chief.

That recoil he does when he sees his son gives me life Absolutely. I love how tosses his things on the counter as if they just don't mean anything to him anymore. They've been pushed so far down on the priority scale, they're probably lucky they even made the counter! GREAT STUFF

So feel free to just take a job teaching English in Korea and you should be fine.

The dad's clap after he puts his stuff down makes it for me Same here, it's like he had determined an amount he wanted to celebrate, and how he wanted to celebrate, and crammed it into what little time he had before embracing his son.

I only ask because I felt the same way about my dad until I was older (mid twenties) and could have an adult relationship with him. As a teenager he was a real hard ass authoritarian (bible thumping too). It didn't bother me much other than be annoying and unnecessary. I was a "good" kid, didn't go out of my way to disobey him or anything, but the few times I broke the rules (always unintentionally and usually outside of my control) he came down on me as if it happened all the time.  		Now that I'm older, I think I understand him better. He wasn't a great dad, he definitely wasn't bad. He could have gone out of his way more to try to develop a relationship with us and take an interest. But he also tried to make us respectful and responsible, and even though his methods weren't great he was doing the best he could.  		 Now that I'm older (30) and he doesn't have to worry about raising me, things have mellowed out dramatically. We have some common interests and the religious stuff we just don't really bring up.  		This may not be the case with your father, I just wanted to bring another perspective that sometimes those things change, and sometimes people don't know any better. Your dad may be grumpy forever, but it may also just be partly due to the stresses of things going on (raising kids, work, etc). That doesn't make it ok, but it may mean that it won't last forever.

Oh man, it always bugs me when I see TVs over the fireplace. That's way too high up, you're gonna hurt your neck like that. And if it's a usable fireplace, that's just a disaster in the making.To each their own. Having my tv on a stand was uncomfortable and mounting it with a tilt down made it soooo much more comfortable watching. Most couches you lean back a little and your head naturally tilts up. It's perfect and makes watching much more comfortable. I don't watch tv with perfect posture in an office chair.
Seriously, I don't want to take anything away from the reunion, but I watched this 2-3 times just to check out how nice that room is. The layout, the black and yellow color scheme, it looks so good. I know! I keep looking at it also. It looks like such a nice warm room to chill in.
Go surprise them sometime soon anyway?My Mom has stroke related dementia. Mostly ok and happy but I moved back to Philly from the West Coast about two years ago.		She always forgets I moved back here so when I see her, she thinks I flew all the way again.		It's *always* a big surprise for her and she is always so happy.		Silver lining, I think.
I recently moved from the east coast to the west coast. Told my parents I didn't have the money to fly home for the holidays. Walked in the door around noon on Christmas day. Awesome feeling. Under promise over execute or whatever that shit is 
I recently moved from the east coast to the west coast. Told my parents I didn't have the money to fly home for the holidays. Walked in the door around noon on Christmas day. Awesome feeling. I did the same thing but two days before! My mom was super upset and bummed about not seeing me as it would be my first Christmas not at home. My fianc knew I couldn't afford it on my own, so he surprised me before thanksgiving with the rest of the money I needed to buy the ticket. When my parents found out he immediately earned back all the points he lost by "taking me away from them" when we moved to Texas. 		It's such a great feeling, though, when you walk in and they go from "Oh well, another holiday...I sure wish (blank) was here..." to "YOU'RE KIDDING ME! Oh My God!!!" I love to think about it when I'm feeling homesick. 
I had to scroll way too far to find this. I love the happiness of the dad seeing his son, and I agree that adding "military" context wasn't at all necessary.It sucks that the immediate thought process is "kid home from deployment". My mom reacts this way when I get home from camp!

This is why i can't respect him or have a relationship with him though cause he's perpetually of the mindset that I'm still a teenager living in his house when I'm actually a grown man with a wife and kid. I had to put him in his place recently for him trying to berate me and birch me out about little things and talking down to me as if i have to obey him still. 		The fact that his kids have moved out and his wife left him has only made him more salty and stubborn since he's lost control.

To each their own. Having my tv on a stand was uncomfortable and mounting it with a tilt down made it soooo much more comfortable watching. Most couches you lean back a little and your head naturally tilts up. It's perfect and makes watching much more comfortable. I don't watch tv with perfect posture in an office chair.I can picture how you sit on a couch, and I don't sit on a couch like that. Above a fireplace would definitely be too high for me because I sit myself upright not leaning my head into the back.

I'm 33 lol. This is why i can't respect him or have a relationship with him though cause he's perpetually of the mindset that I'm still a teenager living in his house when I'm actually a grown man with a wife and kid. I had to put him in his place recently for him trying to berate me and birch me out about little things and talking down to me as if i have to obey him still. 		The fact that his kids have moved out and his wife left him has only made him more salty and stubborn since he's lost control.I totally understand that. I'm glad you are aware of that stuff so that at the very least you can be a better father than that.

Oh gotcha. Wasn't sure what you meant. Thanks for the downvotes everyone, god forbid someone not understand everyone's comments every time!You probably didn't mean it this way, but 'what business are you in?' is a popular not-always-nice gay joke where I come from, so that might explain the downvotes? 		The point of the 'question' in that context is to force the original party to disclose their sexual preference out loud, even though the asker (and everyone else around) already knows that person is gay. In that context the 'joke' is usually meant to belittle the other person, or call out their differences in front of others. 		Hope this was helpful. We all make faux pas, ya know.

We are like elves to dogsThere was a r/WritingPrompts a few weeks ago based on this concept! The stories were absolutely gorgeous, broke my heart and made me cry in the very best way.
We are like elves to dogsI think about this a lot, how weird life must be like for dog's sometimes. Like, there's something called the Dickin Medal, which is basically the Medal of Honor for animals. 		Imagine a dog getting this medal. He goes to some building and a lot of people are there and they talk a lot and they're all very nice to him, they pet him and give him treats and speak to him in affectionate tones, and then they put some kind of collar on him and flash some lights at him and then he goes home and forgets about the whole thing after a few days. For the humans it's a really big deal and for the dog it's just some weird thing that happened.		Sometimes I wonder, if you assume there's a god or angels or whatever, does anything like this ever happen to us? The dog did his job because he knew he should but he'll never understand the honors he received for it. Maybe sometimes we do nice things and then a bunch of weird stuff happens to us and we don't even realize it's some higher power trying to honor us.
We are like elves to dogsI think people who write "i am crying... thanks for posting" are full of it.		Until this post.  This post made me cry.
We are like elves to dogs*cuddling my doggo intensely*
We are like elves to dogsI really like this. 
We are like elves to dogsMan this got me emotional. I'm going to go hug my 100lb Boxer-Bullmastif when I get home. She probably only has a couple years left and I'm going to really miss her when she's gone.
We are like elves to dogsThere was a writing prompt recently that was probably submitted due to this. The top response was so damn [good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts/comments/5e6rcz/_/daafty3)
We are like elves to dogsI highly recommend watching [Touching The Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii4Oke8lb6A), a documentary about a guy who lives with a herd of wild mule deer for a several of their generations.  He basically becomes to these deer what Gandalf was to the Hobbits of Hobbiton.
We are like elves to dogsI'm crying and so are you, don't lie
We are like elves to dogsThis fucked me up. Thanks. 
We are like elves to dogsMy dog died last night. I'm now hiding in the bathroom at work crying. 
We are like elves to dogsThis made me cry. Also relevant for cats too.
We are like elves to dogsSorry to be that guy, but I wonder how it makes a dog feel when some  ' immortals' are unkind to them. I read this and all i could think of were those poor pups who don't know why they're being treated bad. ):
We are like elves to dogsThis is why our mortality, however frail, carries with it immense beauty. Were we truly immortal, we would grow weary of life and become apathetic, nihilistic, we would seek out death. But mortality, it is finite and can end at any moment. Because of that, every breath, every moment that is spent among your loved ones, every activity, no matter how mundane, carries a great weight. The odds of your existence are billions to one, perhaps even more. We are all beings capable of Greatness, be it evil or good. Just remember, while you may die, you have inexorably altered peoples lives merely by being. 		Just remember that, no matter how dark the night, someone out there will be saddened by your passing. In death there is the beauty that is life. You are an "Elf" to someone out there.
We are like elves to dogsYesterday, my daughter asked how old our dog is in dog years. I did the math.		"Uh, 56." 		Where did the time go? She was a puppy just yesterday.
We are like elves to dogsI'm sure this will get drowned out: this post is super popular. My sweet dog is going to pass away soon. He has been my best pal for so long, I love him so much. Never have I known a dog like Bert to have as much character as he does. Next time you think about doggos, please spare a thought for my best friend. He's been a Saint since before I knew him and he'll be a Saint until long after I pass away too. 
We are like elves to dogsWhat is this from again? It's on the tip of my tongue, is it LOTR?
We are like elves to dogsMy dog rolled around in deer shit two hours ago. I've been mad at him since. Now I need to go spend as much time as possible with him.
We are like elves to dogsThis isn't wholesome, this is sad, like damn, that last one was emotional as... I don't even know. I thought this sub was meant to make me happy.

A facebook friend posted this. It made me feel good, and a little sad because one of our dogs recently died, but sad in a good way. I love her, and I know she loved me. I wanted to share it with you, I hope you enjoy it too.My favorite copypasta:		Some of you, particularly those who think they have recently lost a dog to death, dont really understand this. Ive had no desire to explain, but wont be around forever and must.		Dogs never die. They dont know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they dont die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say: No, no, not a good idea. Lets not go for a walk. Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but thats what dogs are. They walk.		Its not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dogs mark, a rotting chicken bone (exultation), and you. Thats what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.		However, dogs get very very sleepy. Thats the thing, you see. They dont teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. Its a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.		When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging its tail madly, you see, and thats why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. Thats when they say: Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.		When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and thats why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, its a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and its a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)		Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and dont want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.		But dont get fooled. They are not dead. Theres no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when youre not expecting it. Its just who they are.		I feel sorry for people who dont have dogs sleeping in their heart. Youve missed so much. Excuse me, I have to go cry now.

He stayed with us for the weekend maybe 2 weeks before he passed, and was such a happy little guy. He slept at the foot of the bed, and we went on a few walks, and it was just good to have him here.

He goes to some building and a lot of people are there and they talk a lot and they're all very nice to him, they pet him and give him treats and speak to him in affectionate tones, and then they put some kind of collar on him and flash some lights at him and then he goes home and forgets about the whole thing after a few days. For the humans it's a really big deal and for the dog it's just some weird thing that happened.		Sometimes I wonder, if you assume there's a god or angels or whatever, does anything like this ever happen to us? The dog did his job because he knew he should but he'll never understand the honors he received for it. Maybe sometimes we do nice things and then a bunch of weird stuff happens to us and we don't even realize it's some higher power trying to honor us.There was a Showerthought (I think) some time ago that stated that dogs do not know that you are in control of the car. From the dog's perspective: 		Sometimes, Dad and I go into this box, and the box goes places. Sometimes the beach, or the park, or a friend, or the vet. You never know. Sometimes for a short time, sometimes for a long time. It's an adventure.		Also, when going to the zoo, the dog has no idea what fences or safeguards are in place. 	This is just me and Dad going into a dangerous place, facing terrible enemies together (tigers, bears, boars, alligators). But Dad is not showing any fear, so time to dog up and stay in control.

*cuddling my doggo intensely*This post reminds me of my dog... He passed away, some months ago... It hit me hard the day he died, but after that I kinda got busy with all sorts of life things... Now, lying here in my bed all I really wanted to was to hear him bark once more, that wild, loud, ear-shattering roar... And I can't help but remember of him as little as my hand... Peeing on the floor for the first time as if he said "This is home now." I love you Thor... I'll love you forever... And I really hope you are better now... You were only 8... I wish I could spend more time with you... I am sorry for my absence... I hope I can see you again. I truly love you...
I really like this. yeah me too but right now i'm like ;.;

I highly recommend watching [Touching The Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii4Oke8lb6A), a documentary about a guy who lives with a herd of wild mule deer for a several of their generations.

My 16 year old pup died two weeks ago. I'm starting to get used to the house without her, but it still stinks. I'm sorry about your dog, I'm sure she was absolutely awesome > I'm starting to get used to the house without her		You will probably take ages to stop shuffling your feet around her favourite spots to avoid stepping on her, though. Sorry for your loss, I'm sure you were very fond of your dog and that she was a good one.
My 16 year old pup died two weeks ago. I'm starting to get used to the house without her, but it still stinks. I'm sorry about your dog, I'm sure she was absolutely awesome My 17 year old girl died last year not a day goes by that I don't miss waking up to her scratching at me 
My 16 year old pup died two weeks ago. I'm starting to get used to the house without her, but it still stinks. I'm sorry about your dog, I'm sure she was absolutely awesome Well, since no one has done it yet:		"Some of you, particularly those who think they have recently lost a dog to 'death', dont really understand this. Ive had no desire to explain, but wont be around forever and must.		Dogs never die. They dont know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they dont die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say: 'No, no, not a good idea. Let's not go for a walk.' Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that's what dogs are. They walk.		Its not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dogs mark, a rotting chicken bone (exultation), and you. Thats what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.		However, dogs get very very sleepy. Thats the thing, you see. They don't teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. Its a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.		When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging its tail madly, you see, and thats why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. Thats when they say: 'Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.'		When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and thats why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, its a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it's a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)		Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and dont want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.		But dont get fooled. They are not 'dead.' Theres no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when youre not expecting it. Its just who they are."

Last May I lost my golden but even on her last day, she wouldn't get up from the garden in our backyard for anything, but she ran as fast as she could to me when she heard the leash. 		Despite how weak she looked I took her on that walk. Our usual walk, to the park at the top of my hill, throwing a tennis ball around for a little and then back down my hill. 		Each step she took she looked like she was going to collapse. As soon as we started I realized I made a terrible mistake and she shouldn't be walking when she was this weak. I tried to turn around. Sandy wouldn't have it. She was walking up that hill with me whether I liked it or not. She was gasping after only a few steps. I didn't think she was gonna make it. 		That bitch proved me wrong. We enjoyed our last walk together and she died a couple hours later. 		I still think about her all the time.

I recall a poem I read somewhere (and just remembering it by looking it up has got me so upset, but here it is): 	  	I stood by your bed last night, I came to have a peep.  	I could see that you were crying, You found it hard to sleep.  	   	I whined to you softly as you brushed away a tear,  	Its me, I havent left you, Im well, Im fine, Im here.  	  	I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea,  	You were thinking of the many times, your hands reached down to me.  	  	I was with you at the shops today, Your arms were getting sore.  	I longed to take your parcels, I wish I could do more.  	  	I was with you at my grave today, You tend it with such care.  	I want to reassure you, that Im not lying there.  	  	I walked with you towards the house, as you fumbled for your key.  	I gently put my paw on you, I smiled and said its me.  	  	You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair.  	I tried so hard to let you know, that I was standing there.  	  	Its possible for me, to be so near you everyday.  	To say to you with certainty, I never went away.  	  	You sat there very quietly, then smiled, I think you knew   	in the  stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.  	   	The day is over and I smile and watch you yawning,  	And say goodnight, God bless, Ill see you in the morning.  	   	And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,  	Ill rush across to greet you and well stand, side by side.  	   	I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see!  	Be patient, live your journey out - then come home to be with me. 	  	I *do* cry every single time. So poignant.

They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but thats what dogs are. They walk.		Its not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dogs mark, a rotting chicken bone (exultation), and you. Thats what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.		However, dogs get very very sleepy. Thats the thing, you see. They dont teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. Its a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.		When you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging its tail madly, you see, and thats why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. Thats when they say: Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.		When they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and thats why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, its a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and its a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)		Anyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and dont want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.		But dont get fooled. They are not dead. Theres no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when youre not expecting it. Its just who they are.		I feel sorry for people who dont have dogs sleeping in their heart. Youve missed so much. Excuse me, I have to go cry now.I think ninjas threw some sand in my eyes, where are all these tears coming from?

There was a Showerthought (I think) some time ago that stated that dogs do not know that you are in control of the car. From the dog's perspective: 		Sometimes, Dad and I go into this box, and the box goes places. Sometimes the beach, or the park, or a friend, or the vet. You never know. Sometimes for a short time, sometimes for a long time. It's an adventure.		Also, when going to the zoo, the dog has no idea what fences or safeguards are in place. 	This is just me and Dad going into a dangerous place, facing terrible enemies together (tigers, bears, boars, alligators). But Dad is not showing any fear, so time to dog up and stay in control.can dogs go to zoos?

I think cats are like the dwarves of this head space. They act all disdainful of people, but put them together and they end up proving they actually love each other and end up on a ship together.So in our breakup my ex got our cats. She came over to our apartment yesterday while I was at work to grab the rest of her stuff. While she was here she took every photo of our cats that I had. I don't have digital versions of any of the pictures. So I have been very emotional about my cats today. Reading this literally had me in tears.

She was basically immobile. The vet recommended that they put her down but they decided to get her one of those little wheel chariots. She loves it and it's so sweet. 
My 17 year old girl died last year not a day goes by that I don't miss waking up to her scratching at me I just found out that we're soon going to have to put down my first dog I'd ever had, and not looking forward to when she's gone
This is a little too close to home. Last May I lost my golden but even on her last day, she wouldn't get up from the garden in our backyard for anything, but she ran as fast as she could to me when she heard the leash. 		Despite how weak she looked I took her on that walk. Our usual walk, to the park at the top of my hill, throwing a tennis ball around for a little and then back down my hill. 		Each step she took she looked like she was going to collapse. As soon as we started I realized I made a terrible mistake and she shouldn't be walking when she was this weak. I tried to turn around. Sandy wouldn't have it. She was walking up that hill with me whether I liked it or not. She was gasping after only a few steps. I didn't think she was gonna make it. 		That bitch proved me wrong. We enjoyed our last walk together and she died a couple hours later. 		I still think about her all the time. I held it back through all these other stories, but you, you had to go and make me cry.

Oh man, now I am near tears. I recall a poem I read somewhere (and just remembering it by looking it up has got me so upset, but here it is): 	  	I stood by your bed last night, I came to have a peep.  	I could see that you were crying, You found it hard to sleep.  	   	I whined to you softly as you brushed away a tear,  	Its me, I havent left you, Im well, Im fine, Im here.  	  	I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea,  	You were thinking of the many times, your hands reached down to me.  	  	I was with you at the shops today, Your arms were getting sore.  	I longed to take your parcels, I wish I could do more.  	  	I was with you at my grave today, You tend it with such care.  	I want to reassure you, that Im not lying there.  	  	I walked with you towards the house, as you fumbled for your key.  	I gently put my paw on you, I smiled and said its me.  	  	You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair.  	I tried so hard to let you know, that I was standing there.  	  	Its possible for me, to be so near you everyday.  	To say to you with certainty, I never went away.  	  	You sat there very quietly, then smiled, I think you knew   	in the  stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.  	   	The day is over and I smile and watch you yawning,  	And say goodnight, God bless, Ill see you in the morning.  	   	And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,  	Ill rush across to greet you and well stand, side by side.  	   	I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see!  	Be patient, live your journey out - then come home to be with me. 	  	I *do* cry every single time. So poignant.	 	Ok, now I'm crying.		Thank you for this

Get another dog to fill your house with love.	Plus you can tell the new one all the good stories about your pup that passed.My kids and I recently started volunteering at the animal shelter. The hardest part is that we'd like to adopt all of the dogs. The nice part is that often when we go back to do the volunteer work many of the dogs are already adopted. They do a really nice job at this particular shelter. It's a no-kill shelter.

I just found out that we're soon going to have to put down my first dog I'd ever had, and not looking forward to when she's goneDog lovers love dogs. The phrase "Get another dog" sounds so jaded...almost like a new dog will fill the hole that the old dog left. I'll always miss my own first dog Zeke.

I just found out that we're soon going to have to put down my first dog I'd ever had, and not looking forward to when she's goneYeah definitely a rough experience, but it gets better with time. It's better than your little pal living in pain or discomfort constantly. 
I just found out that we're soon going to have to put down my first dog I'd ever had, and not looking forward to when she's goneJust know that you gave her the best life she could have had. I know it won't completely stop the hurting, but it's a little bit of help
I just found out that we're soon going to have to put down my first dog I'd ever had, and not looking forward to when she's goneI know this feeling is awful but remember happiness is not 0 sum. The joy and happiness you brought your friend throughout his or her life is order of magnitude greater than the hurt you're feeling now. The pain you feel is the sacrifice you've made to give a friend a literal lifetime of happiness. You've done a wonderful thing.
I just found out that we're soon going to have to put down my first dog I'd ever had, and not looking forward to when she's goneOur dogs we just let die naturally and they actually seemed quite peaceful about it. My first dog had a stroke and she was a little disabled but she could still go in and out. I would just sit with her and pet her and then she just went outside one day and crawled under a bush and died. It was so sad but she died very peacefully right after I had been hugging her and petting her.

This'll cheer you up!My grandma and Charles Schultz (creator of the peanuts), used to work on a team together, and when she left to go have a family, Schultz drew a picture of her and all her future kids around her. They all look a lot like Charlie Brown. She also said that a few people around of the office seemed suspiciously similar to some of the characters in the peanuts.

This sub is one of the best things that has happened to Reddit.It really is. In the last two months I have blocked a dozen or so subs. Before the election I had never needed to bother but the negativity from all directions became overwhelming. I am thrilled to see this #1 on my feed.

I was supposed to see my friend for the first time since high school and I was really looking forward to it. We'd actually been texting back and forth for a few weeks now, and she had to be in town for work so we made a "date" of it. Turns out, her supervisor switched things up on her at the last minute and she wouldn't be coming around. I thought oh well, might as well still grab a coffee since I was going there anyway. To my complete embarrassment, I walk into the cafe and see her sitting there with her "high school crush". Apparently he found out she'd be around and asked to meet, and she lied to me because she'd rather see him. I should have just left and I hate that I didn't, but for whatever reason I decided to confront them about it. As I was walking over, I was suddenly ambushed by The Undertaker and the Loch Ness monster, who proceeded to beat the crap out of me with jumper cables. I don't know what I was thinking. 		Anyway, sorry for the long post. Just wanted to share and get that off my chest. And for the record, this GIF definitely helped. :)

I basically feel like this everyday ughHey, I know how that feels. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for many years, so if you need to talk, please PM me. There are no magic words to make you feel better, but please take it one day at a time, and remember that even a random internet stranger cares about you. Please, talk if you need to. If not to me, than to someone you care about, or, even better, a trained professional. I know I felt a lot better talking to someone who had no personal stake in my life other than to listen and to make me feel better. Which also defines my role in your life at this point, except I am neither trained nor professional. Regardless, I'm here if you need someone to talk to.

Is [this](http://m.imgur.com/PB9d7?r) your friend? my favorite part of this is his face, he has such good humor about the fact that he's holding loose limes for no reason and obviously they're falling all over the place. he's having a good laugh about it.		it's like the opposite is those black and white over-dramatized infomercial things, where mundane things are amplified and the person is overly stressed about it.
Yeah the wife was talking about making some sort of Mexican meal, but imma steal her lime >:DBest part is you can still use the lime in cooking after you crack this joke! She'll laugh, you'll laugh, and then you both can have a wonderful evening cooking and eating! Win-win-win

Its a display of confidence and humor and a compliment to her.  Common traits that are sought after in a partner.  Not that anyone would owe him but it seems like youre acting like pick-up lines are some fucked up thing.No, they're just calling out a problematic assumption some people make that a good pickup line means that the recipient should feel they owe the person a "yes". There's nothing wrong with pickup lines, and I don't think the commenter was saying so, but it would be totally ok for the person being asked to say "Dude that's awesome but I'm not really interested, thanks for making me laugh though."

Simpsons can be really wholesome tooThis might sound strange but I've always thought Homer was a great character/husband/dad. At the end of all the crazy things he does he always tells marge "I love you Marge" and she replies "I love you homie". 	Since I was young I was rooting for him. He's a sweet man but with a simple, impulsive, brain, likely ADD/ADHD If you really want to look into it. The majority of the stunts he pulls are for his families interest (even if they're very flawed)	That, or, he reminded me of my father. (Good and bad).

However Marge gets preggo with Maggie so he has to go beg Burns for his job back. One of the better episodes of the series IMO.
I've never seen this episode, what happens in it? If I recall correctly, Homer finally pays off the mortgage on the house so he quits his job at the nuclear power plant that he hates so he can work his dream job at a bowling alley. It's lower paying but is enough to support Marge, Lisa and Bart and Homer is finally happy. However, Marge gets pregnant with Maggie and to support the additional mouth to feed, Homer begs Mr Burns for his old job back.

I've never seen this episode, what happens in it? Yes, the other comments are right, Homer is finally financially stable and quits his job, but this is a flashback, most of the episode is a flashback from a few months or years ago.		It all starts when Bart and Lisa ask why aren't there any Maggie pictures in the family album.		At the end of the episode Bart insists: "Yeah, but you still didn't explain why there are no Maggie pictures"		Homer replies: "I have them exactly where I need them".		And we see the image on the lower frame of OP's image.

Homer didn't use to be dim-witted. Just simple, average, well-meaning, with a lot of human flaws.

That said, as you mention he's always been portrayed as having human flaws and even as not being smart.  It just was not originally his defining character trait.

Pronouncing it (weigh-lawn) makes it sound like an impoverished country in the midst of a war.		edit: to all people correcting me, I am attempting to pronounce it incorrectly for the sake of the joke.It's odd that you would choose "weigh" instead of "way" to describe the pronunciation when the latter is spelled much closer to how it sounds. English is strange.

Do you mean the *finale finale* or the original finale?I forget which one it is.. possibly the final finale, where Fry and Lela get stuck in time and at the end he asks Lela if she wants to go around again.
It's sad that the revival didn't capture all the spirit of the first four seasons. I really thought it did pretty well. I think the overall hit rate of the last few seasons isn't as good, but it still has several truly top-tier episodes.

One of the better episodes of the series IMO.It's one of my favourite episodes -- not just because it's an emotional one, but because it has some of my favourite jokes in the series, like Homer's walk home when everybody knows about Marge's pregnancy except for him:		Homer: Ah, another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.		Wiggum: [driving by] Hey, just heard the news over the squawk box. That's nice work, Homer.		Homer: Thank you, thank you very much.  It is nice work.		Apu: Oh, Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of joy.  Congratulations, sir!		Homer: It's true, the bundle is little, but I'm not in it for the money.		Moe: Hey, Homer!  Way to get Marge pregnant!		Homer: This is getting very abstract, but thank you. I *do* enjoy working at the bowling alley.		Followed by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZEm9_U_OiM).

What is Flanderization?It's when they take the quirk of a character and make it the entire character. It actually comes from the Simpsons character Ned Flanders. He is the Simpson's neighbor who is a devout Christian. But overall a well adjusted person. As the show went on he became crazy religious and lost his humble but friendly neighbor 
What is Flanderization?The tendency for a character in a long-running series to become less like a real person and more of a caricature over-emphasizing one extreme personality trait.		The titular example is Ned Flanders in The Simpsons who started off as a regular dad who was somewhat religious, to his religious faith becoming more and more extreme until he was basically just a caricature.		It's pretty common, and you can see it in any series that has become popular, not just comedy - the writers see one aspect of a character that audiences seem to identify with and make him or her more and more of an extreme example of that personality type.		For other examples, see pretty much every character in Everybody Loves Raymond, Chandler in Friends, Always Sunny in Philadelphia seems to do it deliberately, etc.  Any it's not just comedy, if there is a slightly quirky character in a crime drama he or she will be full on neurotic a few series later.

The characters changed a lot that's for sure, but I've been watching Family Guy on Netflix lately and I started around season 8, and went to 14, now I'm rewatching from 1, and overall the jokes are the same.  	Yes the characters have deviated from what they were originally, but the humor is more or less the same as when it started.  Random jokes here, with some gay jokes, sex jokes, and misogynistic jokes, add in some celebrity references.
Id rather have the job security.Wanna trade?
It's odd that you would choose "weigh" instead of "way" to describe the pronunciation when the latter is spelled much closer to how it sounds. English is strange. Yeah they both sound the same and I can't imagine any other way to pronounce Waylon.
The Hermes + Bender origin really got me personally and I think it's a tad underappreciated[Little Bird Little Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz6WRiNwujQ)
The Hermes + Bender origin really got me personally and I think it's a tad underappreciatedPersonally, the one that got me was when Fry spends the entire episode rearranging stars for Leela to leave her a note. Gets me every time.
The Hermes + Bender origin really got me personally and I think it's a tad underappreciatedThe only problem that episode has is it happens so late in the series, and isn't about Fry, that when people talk about favorite episodes it's after the time the best episode occur, and when people talk about tragic Fry episodes, it doesn't get included. That episode exists in a set of only itself. 
The Hermes + Bender origin really got me personally and I think it's a tad underappreciatedFry with Lars absolutely kills me every time. That scene when it clicks and he realizes who Lars is has, and I think always will, blow me away.

That song gets me every time. I have it on my "Time to Cry" playlist.[:'(](http://i.imgur.com/jJlJPar.jpg)
I forget which one it is.. possibly the final finale, where Fry and Lela get stuck in time and at the end he asks Lela if she wants to go around again.Yep, that's the final finale.  Such a touching way to end the series. 
I really thought it did pretty well. I think the overall hit rate of the last few seasons isn't as good, but it still has several truly top-tier episodes. That time traveling forward episode was dope top 15 of the whole show imo

He's also totally complaining the whole time Marge is pregnant, even while Marge is in labour, but when Maggie reaches out and grabs his finger after being born, Homer instantly falls in love. As a dad who had his son grab his finger within 5 minutes of being born this us the only episode of the Simpsons I have seen and it reduced me to a fucking mess of tears 
He's also totally complaining the whole time Marge is pregnant, even while Marge is in labour, but when Maggie reaches out and grabs his finger after being born, Homer instantly falls in love. Also, seeing all the photos of Maggie on his wall at work is the Citizen Kane style "reveal" at the end - the rest of the episode prior to that is a flashback which attempts to explain why he has no photos of Maggie in the photo books at home.		There's a running joke in some episodes of The Simpsons that Homer sometimes seems to forget he has a third daughter (in episodes both before and after this), and this episode lovingly plays on that, proving that in reality it isn't really the case and she's special to him.
It's one of my favourite episodes -- not just because it's an emotional one, but because it has some of my favourite jokes in the series, like Homer's walk home when everybody knows about Marge's pregnancy except for him:		Homer: Ah, another perfect day in my perfect life with my perfect job.		Wiggum: [driving by] Hey, just heard the news over the squawk box. That's nice work, Homer.		Homer: Thank you, thank you very much.  It is nice work.		Apu: Oh, Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of joy.  Congratulations, sir!		Homer: It's true, the bundle is little, but I'm not in it for the money.		Moe: Hey, Homer!  Way to get Marge pregnant!		Homer: This is getting very abstract, but thank you. I *do* enjoy working at the bowling alley.		Followed by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZEm9_U_OiM).Easily one of the best simpsons jokes!

Aw that sounds like that episode would get me a bit emotional. Thanks for explaining!The important part he left out is that after Homer begs for his job back, the one condition to him getting the job is that he must work every day with that plaque.

I was singing along to "it's over, isn't it" and "here comes a thought" on there way home today, and they're both so emotional. On the second one, my husband turned the volume down to listen to me sing and squeezed my hand tight. We're going through a really changeable time right now and I don't think we realized until then what a meaningful song it is for us.		I can't wait for my daughter to be old enough to understand it.

Oh, no. Family Guy has gotten way worse that the Simpsons.

Oh, no. Family Guy has gotten way worse that the Simpsons. The Simpsons is just dull, while Family Guy is actively terrible.The only reason family guy is still around is because it's the choice of middle school kids everywhere for "edgy 'adult' cartoons". They watch it thinking it's still cutting edge and edgy. 		I mean I guess it probably is if you're in middle school and your entire concept of nuance is just being raunchy for raunchiness sake. 		I mean if you've never seen another "adult" cartoon and a recent family guy episode is all you saw, you might like it too. It's partly that you've seen it and all it has to offer already. 		E: I'm not saying it's bad to like the show. Just a large deal of its popularity comes from that. I still watch the occasional episode or two on netflix, but I just don't enjoy it like I used to. I mean obviously the show is still popular (and doing well afaik) and I was generalizing more for comedic effect rather than to call anyone who liked it a middle schooler. People like mindless fun sometimes, whoda thunk.

Yeah they both sound the same and I can't imagine any other way to pronounce Waylon.hWaylon
Yeah they both sound the same and I can't imagine any other way to pronounce Waylon.Well, the "way" part is pretty obvious but the "lawn" part not so much. I, and probably lots of people, would say "way-len" or "way-lin" since it sounds awkward to pronounce the drawn out "lawn" sound while also trying to emphasize the first syllable. It's like the difference in pronunciation between Devon and Devin, except still spelled Waylon and I've never heard it pronounced way-LAWN like day-VAWN is. That's my take on it at least.

Piano practiceThis is great. Wish I couldve made a request. I broke a finger a while back and I can't play for more than a minute or so without excruciating pain. 			Edit- [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgVytt_XnZI) is one of my all time favorite pieces. Its nothing super famous but it speaks to me deeply. I used to play it, looping over and over again. I tried it a few months ago. I cant play more than half of it. Oh well \^^		Edit2.0-		The injury occured in a fight. The knuckle got forcibly jammed back when it broke(take a stick, put it between your palms, and pressit together until it snaps up, thats what happened). The only thing that can really fix it is some major surgery that I dont want to nor have the ability to pay for. The finger is still fully working, its just that repetitive motion starts to hurt.		I play bass, drums and I am currently learning violin.		Thanks for all the well wishes yall
Piano practiceI wanna request music for that neighbor. I bet they'd like Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in G Minor. I hope I wrote that right. 
Piano practiceLiebestraum No 3 is hands down the most beautiful song to play. While I was learning it, I had recently broken up with my first serious girlfriend and it broke my heart. I would play the song with this passion that came from within and when I finished learning it and perfected the last stanza, I broke down in tears. There's something about the song that just resonates with a broken heart.		Liebestraum means "Love Dream", written by Franz Liszt of the famous "Lisztomania", the first recognized case of a musician gathering a fanatic woman following, making them faint at his sight. The song was written about three poems:		>The two poems by Uhland and the one by Freiligrath depict three different forms of love. Uhland's Hohe Liebe (exalted love) is saintly or religious love: the "martyr" renounces worldly love and "heaven has opened its gates". The second song Seliger Tod (blessed death) is often known by its first line ("Gestorben war ich", "I had died"), and evokes erotic love; "dead" could be a metaphor here referring to what is known as "la petite mort" in French ("I was dead from love's bliss; I lay buried in her arms; I was wakened by her kisses; I saw heaven in her eyes"). Freiligrath's poem for the famous third Notturno is about unconditional mature love ("Love as long as you can!", "O lieb, so lang du lieben kannst").		It's the unconditional mature love that's woven into No 3 that hit my heart so much. It's really bizarre how some Romantic era songs can do that. I highly recommend it to anyone reading.
Piano practiceEvery time I'm playing my sax loudly people ask me about to play that George Michael song
Piano practiceI once had a neighbour with the voice of an angel. 		If I knew what apartment she loved in, I fully would have made requests. 	Thinking about her belting out Rolling In The Deep gives me chills. It was amazing. 
Piano practiceGood for you, OP. I'm working my way through Chopin's Nocturnes. I would be horrified if the neighbours heard me practice. I've been playing for 45 years now, but I hate performing. I envy people who can play for others without all their spit drying up. 
Piano practiceThis feels a bit like a /r/thathappened post, but it makes me feel good so I'm going to ignore that.
Piano practiceA number of years ago, when I was learning guitar, I'd like to unwind by fooling around on blues scales.  There was one time when my downstairs neighbor asked me to turn it down.  The next time I got a knock on my door, this time from a different neighbor, I preempted them and said that I'd turn it down.		Unexpectedly, they said that they actually enjoyed hearing me play and hung out for a bit while I messed around on the guitar.  It was really encouraging, especially since I was relatively new to playing guitar and knew I wasn't terribly good.  Knowing that someone took the time to tell me they liked what I was doing helped push me to keep learning.		Even better, I made a friend in the process and when I was down and out, looking for work, she helped me get a job where she worked.  That job was the springboard that helped me develop a worthwhile career that has helped me do some wonderful things in my life.  Before then, I'd been mostly working dead end jobs to make ends meet.		Overall, the experience helped me realize that when you put yourself out there for people to judge, you'll sometimes get a little discouragement, but you also open yourself up to the rewarding experiences that life has to offer.  Shutting yourself off guards you from negative feedback, but you also insulate yourself from opportunity.

Piano practiceAt my childhood home we had some woods in the backyard that separated us from some neighbors, and we had one neighbor across the woods that would play his banjo on the porch.

Piano practiceMy mom grew up in the 50's with a love of the piano. As the youngest of six, it was great for her to have a natural talent and hobby to throw herself into. She ended up winning a pretty significant contest at a pretty young age (<10), which was open to all ages. As a teenager, she lost interest. But, as an adult, she bought a piano and started playing again. 		At one point on a spring day, she had been playing for a while in front of a window and when she stopped, she heard clapping from outside. A neighbor had paused his dog walk to sit, entranced by music. 		The thought that people outside could hear her play horrified my mother. She sold the piano and, twenty years later, has never played again. This is the anecdote I start with when explaining to folks about the people who raised me. 
Piano practiceSo, the person who posted this just happened to know the requested piece? I am not familiar with the piece. Is it standard repertoire? I suppose the person could have sight read it?
Piano practiceI would love this.  Honestly if I had a piano I would hire someone to play all types of classical music on a nice day.  Sit out on the deck and just drift off into your own world.  How awesome would that be?
Piano practiceStory time:		My dad's a professional pianist (haha it sounds like penis) and I grew up with a piano in my living room.		During the summer when the windows and door would be open he would practice loud enough for our neighbors to hear.  It became a bit of a joke and when I would see neighbors in the street they would often say something like, "Bill must have a concert coming up.  I haven't heard him practice this much in a long time!"		I often fell asleep to him practicing...good memories.

He brought in loads of topsoil so he could fill the little crevices with dirt and he would plant flowers, place birdbaths, and plant veggies. 		Every year he had so many cucumbers and tomatoes that he would put them all save a few for him and my grandma in little plastic bags and set them on everyone's doorknobs. He loved sharing his excess as he had grown up very, very poor in the depression era. 		I used to love climbing on top of that mountain to watch the birds and stare at the flowers.

The neighbor's handwriting is gorgeous.That handwriting, to me, is that of an old German grandmother.
The neighbor's handwriting is gorgeous.As beautiful as it is, i never really learned how to read cursive. My school decided it was a outdated skill and decided to focus on other things.

The neighbor's handwriting is gorgeous.That's the kind of handwriting you request classical music with. Mine is for requesting Hoobastank.
This is great. Wish I couldve made a request. I broke a finger a while back and I can't play for more than a minute or so without excruciating pain. 			Edit- [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgVytt_XnZI) is one of my all time favorite pieces. Its nothing super famous but it speaks to me deeply. I used to play it, looping over and over again. I tried it a few months ago. I cant play more than half of it. Oh well \^^		Edit2.0-		The injury occured in a fight. The knuckle got forcibly jammed back when it broke(take a stick, put it between your palms, and pressit together until it snaps up, thats what happened). The only thing that can really fix it is some major surgery that I dont want to nor have the ability to pay for. The finger is still fully working, its just that repetitive motion starts to hurt.		I play bass, drums and I am currently learning violin.		Thanks for all the well wishes yallI'm sorry to hear that, I hope that it heals so you can play again

I wanna request music for that neighbor. I bet they'd like Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in G Minor. I hope I wrote that right. You did.		Everything by Chopin is phenomenal
I wanna request music for that neighbor. I bet they'd like Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in G Minor. I hope I wrote that right. You don't usually need to worry about naming classical pieces too specifically because they aren't "named" in the way we understand songs now. The titles were more like practical labels used to identify a piece, especially in the case of Chopin, the idea was that the music was of a certain purity as to not need a dramatic title. You could call it Chopin's first Ballad, Chopins g minor ballad, Ballad no. 1, or anything along those lines and nobody will judge you.
I once had a neighbour with the voice of an angel. 		If I knew what apartment she loved in, I fully would have made requests. 	Thinking about her belting out Rolling In The Deep gives me chills. It was amazing. Our guide on our river rafting trip was training as an opera singer. At night, by firelight, she'd sing for us, and her voice echoed throughout the red rock canyons. It was haunting and beautiful. Enrapturing. It was one of the best things about the entire trip. 
Good for you, OP. I'm working my way through Chopin's Nocturnes. I would be horrified if the neighbours heard me practice. I've been playing for 45 years now, but I hate performing. I envy people who can play for others without all their spit drying up. Me too, I prefer just playing for myself than to someone else.... but I also like playing to someone else :)
This feels a bit like a /r/thathappened post, but it makes me feel good so I'm going to ignore that.Depends on where you live.  Keys tend to be one that people like, guitar is asking for issues.  
This feels a bit like a /r/thathappened post, but it makes me feel good so I'm going to ignore that.It actually happens though. Once I was practicing a room on my college campus and some anonymous person left a note. I thought it was going to say to not use that piano again (I wasn't technically supposed to be in that room), but it was actually complementing the piece I was playing. Probably one of the nicest random acts that's ever happened to me.

But after he was diagnosed (a couple years before he died), he met a number of other musicians during his hospital visits, and soon became a band member with a group otherwise made up of doctors and lab techs. Unfortunately I wasn't able to see him perform in this band, but met the other members at his wake, who told me they ensured he got a few solos at the last show he played. Oddly I think the last year of his life was one of his best.

My grandfather used to live in an apartment building on top of a mountain -- black rock, harsh environment. 		He brought in loads of topsoil so he could fill the little crevices with dirt and he would plant flowers, place birdbaths, and plant veggies. 		Every year he had so many cucumbers and tomatoes that he would put them all save a few for him and my grandma in little plastic bags and set them on everyone's doorknobs. He loved sharing his excess as he had grown up very, very poor in the depression era. 		I used to love climbing on top of that mountain to watch the birds and stare at the flowers. Hope I can develop as green a thumb as him someday. Bruh that is straight up some Ghibli/Pixar kinda shit right there.

The best idea is that you do not play during the worst hours of the day, you make sure you give them your number so they can text/call if its a bad time, and you play quietly. 		It's absurd how loud some drummers have to play; the true tell of whether or not a drummer is good is how well they can play quietly. I never needed to play loud to get my practice in. I simply play with quieter sticks and developed adequate control over my sticks so that fast didn't really mean loud.

I have grade 8, and decided to learn this exact piece for my diploma, so I can tell you how it went.		Firstly, it's considered one of Liszt's easier pieces. For comparison, see La Campanella, Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2, and Mephisto Waltz.		The first 2 pages went alright. I picked them up in about 2 months of practicing an hour a day 6 days a week, with 2 hour long lessons every week. The first cadenza then took another month to get to an acceptable level. The next page took me another 2 months, and the page after that 3 more. Then another cadenza appeared, and 2 months later I could finally play that at about half speed. The final 2 pages weren't so bad, and they only took about 1 more month. 		All in all, I spent a year learning this piece to point where I could play from start to end at half speed. I can honestly say it is both the most challenging and most rewarding thing I have ever done. I never did finish learning it - I had to take a break for 3 months for personal reasons, and when I came back I had forgotten most of it.

It's never too late to learn.  Curious question how do you sign your name if not in cursive?Not the person you asked but I personally can't read or write in cursive. I had to have a certain amount of time in remedial learning for my Dyslexia in grade school and they decided the best time to pull me out of class for that was when my regular class would be learning cursive. When I was old enough to actually have to sign for things as a teenager I had my mom write out my name in cursive and I copied that over and over again until it became muscle memory!

Anna Fedorova on Youtube is my favorite right now, other than the vinyls of Rachmaninoff himself doing it with the Philadelphia Orchestra.		* Jardins Sous La Pluie (Gardens in the Rain) by Debussy.

It's very well known, and probably not sight-readable, so I'd say he already knew it.Definitely not sight readable, it's one of those that you have to practice bpm by bpm and let the muscle memory grow. You're jumping all over the place, playing octave chords then arpeggios the octave below. There's also two cadenzas, which are a lot easier than they look but again it's all about building up the speed.		That said, the first and last sections could be sight-read by an expert.
A guitar player used to live above me. He would play on his acoustic a lot and it sounded lovely coming from above, somewhat muted from the ceiling.

It sucks since he moved out. I always loved hearing him play whatever as a backdrop to my little simple life in my 1 bedroom apartment. Sometimes it was like he was playing for me. and I had a neighbor decide 4am was a good time to start practicing drums.		He's not my neighbor anymore.

One of our neighbors (their property backs against ours) plays the bagpipes. He practices outside every Tuesday and Thursday. At first it was terrible, but he's gotten much better. The days he doesn't play are disappointing now.  His improvement over time and your enjoyment of his hobby is very wholesome. I love the extra stories in the comments. Thanks for sharing. :)

The days he doesn't play are disappointing now.  There was a guy in my drum corps who had bagpipes on tour.  Every once in a while I'd wander away from the cacophony of a dozen trucks and at least twice that many buses in a single parking lot only to hear him practicing somewhere off in the distance.		I'm not exactly a bagpipe aficionado so probably not a good judge, but I'm pretty sure this guy was *always* good.  Or at least it was really nice to listen to. =D
I used to live beside a porn addict and a hooker, I was basically surrounded by very fainted moaning everyday......

If you're anything like your username, though, you probably liked it. 
I'm a drummer. 		I've actually never had complaints from neighbors. The best idea is that you do not play during the worst hours of the day, you make sure you give them your number so they can text/call if its a bad time, and you play quietly. 		It's absurd how loud some drummers have to play; the true tell of whether or not a drummer is good is how well they can play quietly. I never needed to play loud to get my practice in. I simply play with quieter sticks and developed adequate control over my sticks so that fast didn't really mean loud.Don't they also make drum mutes that decrease reverb? And putting your drum kit on a folded up blanket would help soften the sound for a downstairs neighbor.
There's a mysterious piano player in my apartment block, of whom I can never quite make out the direction but they will randomly play beautifully and it's awesome on summer days. I also assume they have perhaps a child or a student, because the quality of the songs will sometimes differ drastically:DI had a mysterious/untraceable opera singer in my old building, I was so excited when I finally met him as he was hanging a poster in our laundry room for a chorus performance...I may have scared him a little lol, but he really had a beautiful voice! I could sit on my patio during the day and just enjoy the music floating up from below, I miss that.

That sounds sweet, may I ask what happened after you found out you fell in love? :)'Twas many summers ago when I was in college... My dear friend, and roommate, planned to go home for the summer after we signed a lease in April. She quickly found a replacement roommate for the summer. He was a couple years ahead in college and had a summer internship in Del Mar. He was from the east coast and had no one here. I worked nights and our other roommate was rather antisocial. She hid in her room 90% of the time she was home. It was also my first summer in San Diego.		We became fast friends. We didn't have a tv or much for entertainment (I was still under drinking age). His parents had rented him a nice car to use while away from home. We both wanted to get out and explore San Diego. It started with random drives to no where in particular and then led to chasing the sunset on almost a weekly basis. He would get home from work and I hadn't done anything but sleep all day. We'd jump in the car and blast the music we loved as we raced to Sunset Cliffs to catch another glimpse of the sunset. It never felt old. 		On the nights I didn't have to work, we'd go to the nearby grocery store and he'd buy us a type of beer he'd want me to try. We'd light the fire pit in our backyard and drink the night away. This became a weekend ritual. After some time, we were doing everything together. 		We felt like a couple. We went grocery shopping and he'd tickle me when he found me a couple aisles down. I was feeling depressed one night and sat on the kitchen floor crying. He found me and sat with me. The thought crossed my mind, "I never want to be anywhere you're not." I knew I had messed up.		My mom came to visit for 4th of July. We went to go watch the fireworks at the Big Bay Boom. This year was the most memorable... they lit off all of them at once. It felt like a perfect metaphor for our summer together. We went home and in my disappointment of missing a real fireworks show we drank. A lot. I don't quite recall who kissed who first, but one thing led to another...		The next day, while he was at work he text me.  He told me that last night couldn't happen again. He let me down easy. A few days passed and my mom went home. A few weeks passed and it was time for his family and his long-term girlfriend to come visit. I left like a thief in the night. All I left was a sticky note on the door indicating that I had gone to my hometown for the week. 		Upon my return we went back to being friends. The flirtation had faded away. He went to his room most nights and played guitar instead of chasing sunsets with me. I would sit up against our wall and listen to him play. Every once in a while I'd hear a familiar tune: Jack Johnson, my favorite artist at the time. I think he knew I was listening. 		Once in his car at the grocery store I asked for a kiss. He reluctantly agreed. I still feel terrible for putting him in such a position. 		His final days were soon upon us. We planned a last hoorah at a local restaurant we had discovered together. Things felt scattered. I wrote him a letter and hid it in his suitcase. I thanked him for the best summer and let him know I was falling in love with him. I told him to marry her (and he did). We haven't spoken much since. 
That sounds sweet, may I ask what happened after you found out you fell in love? :)He moved out, like the guitarist

We didn't have a tv or much for entertainment (I was still under drinking age). His parents had rented him a nice car to use while away from home. We both wanted to get out and explore San Diego. It started with random drives to no where in particular and then led to chasing the sunset on almost a weekly basis. He would get home from work and I hadn't done anything but sleep all day. We'd jump in the car and blast the music we loved as we raced to Sunset Cliffs to catch another glimpse of the sunset. It never felt old. 		On the nights I didn't have to work, we'd go to the nearby grocery store and he'd buy us a type of beer he'd want me to try. We'd light the fire pit in our backyard and drink the night away. This became a weekend ritual. After some time, we were doing everything together. 		We felt like a couple. We went grocery shopping and he'd tickle me when he found me a couple aisles down. I was feeling depressed one night and sat on the kitchen floor crying. He found me and sat with me. The thought crossed my mind, "I never want to be anywhere you're not." I knew I had messed up.		My mom came to visit for 4th of July. We went to go watch the fireworks at the Big Bay Boom. This year was the most memorable... they lit off all of them at once. It felt like a perfect metaphor for our summer together. We went home and in my disappointment of missing a real fireworks show we drank. A lot. I don't quite recall who kissed who first, but one thing led to another...		The next day, while he was at work he text me.  He told me that last night couldn't happen again. He let me down easy. A few days passed and my mom went home. A few weeks passed and it was time for his family and his long-term girlfriend to come visit. I left like a thief in the night. All I left was a sticky note on the door indicating that I had gone to my hometown for the week. 		Upon my return we went back to being friends. The flirtation had faded away. He went to his room most nights and played guitar instead of chasing sunsets with me. I would sit up against our wall and listen to him play. Every once in a while I'd hear a familiar tune: Jack Johnson, my favorite artist at the time. I think he knew I was listening. 		Once in his car at the grocery store I asked for a kiss. He reluctantly agreed. I still feel terrible for putting him in such a position. 		His final days were soon upon us. We planned a last hoorah at a local restaurant we had discovered together. Things felt scattered. I wrote him a letter and hid it in his suitcase. I thanked him for the best summer and let him know I was falling in love with him. I told him to marry her (and he did). We haven't spoken much since. That was a great story, even if it was't exactly the happy ending you were probably hoping for. I hope you both find happiness in life.

It is actually called periscoping when snakes do it! I think I've heard it used about rabbits too, when they stand on their hind legs and stretch out tall.Many animals do. They do this to estimate distance between them and the object they are seeing. Many animals have very limited overlap in vision from one eye to the other, so their binocular visions are not very good. They raise their heads so their eyes get a second perspective, then lower to the original perspective to compare.

		> They raise their heads so their eyes get a second perspective, then lower to the original perspective to compare.		TIL animals are better at math and physics than I am.It's not like they're crunching numbers consciously. You're doing the same thing when you look at something. You are seeing two slightly different perspectives, one from each eye, and you are merging them together into a 3D mental model. It's just that you've done it your whole life so you don't think about it... It just happens. When something's hard to see and your squint your eyes to see it better, you're using pressure to slightly reshape your cornea so you can focus better.		We're pretty impressive critters. It's just natural for us so it's easy to overlook.
No matter how many times I read this I have no idea what the OP is trying to say.I think he means, essentially, that since a duck doesn't know it's a duck, it will instinctively go to its "mama," which depending on circumstancesay be a dog or an alligator or in this instance a flamingo, and then learn behaviors from mama and imitate them.
you are also an animal, brotherA party animal!

And they're totally right. Imagine a duck quacking like an asshole every time someone walks by the living room window and lifting its leg to pee on stuff. Good times!

this is adorable. now i want to read a romance manga with this premise. guy keeps trying to perfect love potion but keeps testing it on the girl who already likes him. it probably wouldn't be long but that sounds like a fun premise.NOT WHOLESOME WARNING!		It could easily become a very dark manga where his obsession only grows until he starts to disregard consequences and cut corners. Eventually his potion causes permanent harm to her and before she dies, as he's trying to rationalize to her what he's done, she says she loved him all along. It would be pretty thought provoking/moving imo. 
Are we sure it's wholesome?			It was my understanding that the love potion / spell trope is kinda 'rapey.'You're correct. It's extremely rapey. The guy decided that he wanted her and that he wasn't going to give her a choice in the matter.
Can someone explain this to me?She doesn't feel any different because she's already in love with him
It's a cartoon comic, how can people seriously be offended by this?If there's ever something to be learned by interacting with people on the internet, it's that people can be offended by literally anything.

It's a fictitious concept that's been around forever. That's like saying it's dishonest to wish for endless money because you'll over saturate the market and cause major inflation. It's fantasy. Let you imagination live a little. The difference is that with the money, it's just a consequence of wanting infinite money. You didn't wish to destroy the economy, you wished for money. Just because it's fictional doesn't make it less creepy. Turning invisible and stalking someone isn't possible, but it would be creepy. Making a perfect clone of someone without their consent isn't possible, but it would be creepy. So are love potions, they just weren't portrayed as creepy in a lot of fiction so we don't think of them that way.		Not only that but a love potion is basically just the world's highest quality roofie, which is something that already exists and is considered creepy.

It's the stuff of myth.  It's cupid's arrow.   		If it was someone asking a genie for someone to fall in love with them, you'd probably find it to be fine.   		You're reading into it too much."I *order* you to love me!"

Check out Apollo and Daphne, for instance.

>the intention to drug her into liking him is a bit gross.		Every love, in literal sense, is you getting drugged with brain chemicals and stuff, tho with consent.Consent is everything.
Some men just don't have the guts to tell a girl his feelings, and would much rather have the woman just admit her feelings outright without the stressful courtship.		It's a very common fantasy for men and the "love potion" can be analogous to many other social lubricants such as alcohol. Drinking (for short periods of time, alcoholism is an addiction) doesn't change how someone thinks, only how they act. You're confusing love potion with truth serum. Either of which would be wrong to administer without consent.

The difference is that with the money, it's just a consequence of wanting infinite money. You didn't wish to destroy the economy, you wished for money. Just because it's fictional doesn't make it less creepy. Turning invisible and stalking someone isn't possible, but it would be creepy. Making a perfect clone of someone without their consent isn't possible, but it would be creepy. So are love potions, they just weren't portrayed as creepy in a lot of fiction so we don't think of them that way.		Not only that but a love potion is basically just the world's highest quality roofie, which is something that already exists and is considered creepy.It depends how you look at it.		On one hand, people generally find controlling others' free will to be inherently immoral and creepy.		On the other hand, love potions can create a situation where two people become mutually infatuated with each other and are filled with bliss in a lifelong loving relationship. From a utilitarian perspective you're creating an insurmountable amount of happiness from *creating love*.		It's not even the same as saturating the market- if you're saturating the market you're causing harm to other people. If you're causing someone to fall in love with you, even though it's selfish, you're not taking away from or harming the other person's well-being, you're making them happier. It just makes us upset because we have a notion that free will is more important than happiness.
Yeah no, nothing wholesome about drugging someone into liking you, real or not. Yeah i dont think anyone here thinks thats the wholesome part dude.

>tho with consent. 		There's really not much consent going on sometimes. You might hate the idea of a relationship with someone and you can realize that overall it's a terrible idea and it will just lead to a lot of pain and suffering, but *fuck* your opinion! Genes and hormones don't give a shit about what you think.		There's something magical yet creepy about having zero control over something that can change your life.		>Genes and hormones don't give a shit about what you think.		You're looking at it in a wrong way. My opinion is that genes and hormones **ARE** YOU therefore they give you consent for you, they decide who you are attracted to. They are part of you.		You're talking about emotional and/or physical trauma/abuse and that's a whole different story.		Love potion implies that the person using it is someone you aren't generally attracted to (someone fat, ugly etc) therefore your genes and hormones would give forced consent.
When you fall in love with someone, is that even really your choice?Subconsciously, yes. It is the choice of your genes and whatnot since that is who you are.		Love potion is just human manipulation but its pretty much the same sans consent.

I have to disagree here. Love doesn't mean happiness. Some people are in love knowing that the other one is not good for them. A love potion would have the same effect. It could create love for a person whose actions you might despise. What iff there is a reason you are not in love with them in the first place ? Maybe it just cannot work between the two of you. It doesn't need to be hate, just differents people with differents needs that are incompatible. And there it is, you are in love with someone you might resent, maybe it's a murderer, maybe it's something less serious, but you are stuck in a toxic relationship.

Well, I'm glad you decided, with your own free will, that other people's free will is useless. How kind of you.
Love doesn't remove concent, it just makes someone develop an attachment for someone else. There's no reason why someone who loves someone else can't say no to anything. Hell, if it's anything like my high school crushes, nothing will happen at all anyways. Changing someone's brain chemistry IS removing their ability to consent. By your logic do you believe being given hallucinogenic compounds and then asked a question is all ok?
Haha it's just a comic strip it's not a statement of society or some shit.Fiction is moral discourse.

The moral from this comic is exactly that, to realize that you don't need to drug someone! you learn from the scientist guy's mistake!The comic doesn't portray the attempted drugging as a mistake, though. The scientist guy doesn't suffer any consequences, like the woman telling him "I was into you before, but now that I know you're the kind of person who mind-roofies people, I never want to see you again." Instead, the drugging works out really well for him, because he finds out that she already loves him. Now he can approach her without fear of rejection, and she'll never know what he tried to do to her.
Its about as creepy as Cupids arrow making people fall in love. Jesus man take a chill pill.Well no, it's more like if cupid wasn't the god of love and wasn't necessary for people to fall in love, but just a guy that injected people with mind-control drugs.

Not really, it magically makes them truly love you.  They feel amazing, you feel amazing -- it's magic.   Right, it magically subverts however the other person actually feels. As I've said elsewhere, pick someone you find undesirable. Would you find it cute if they drugged you into loving them?
I don't think people in this thread realize what roofies do.		Hint: It doesn't make the victim fall in love with someone.It takes away consent, just like a love potion would.		People in this thread is just going "love is nice, what's wrong with making people love more". But it seems like they don't get the basic idea of the potion. The only reason you would need it is because the person you want WOULDN'T want to be with you. If they liked you there wouldn't be a need for a potion, so you are actively going against their wishes for your own benefit.		Just imagine the grossest, ugliest and worst person you can and then think about that person slipping you something without your knowledge that made you want to pleasure them forever. Doesn't seem that nice, does it?

What happened to Voldemort about love potions?		Edit- a spellingHis mother fell in love with a muggle, he didn't really care for her, she used a love potion, Voldemort is born 9 months later.
Just saying its better to have loved and lost than not at all right? Some people don't have parents and stuff ya know?

> As someone with the double whammy of depression and anxiety disorders, sometimes I love to blissfully dream about giving up my free will and putting someone else in charge so I can be happy. I would never do it though.		Do you take medication for your depression and anxiety? In doing so you're modifying your own mental state and way of thinking. That's not far off from a potion that makes you feel happier.		>And the big issue with someone forcing you to fall in love with them, is that they aren't doing it to make you happy. They're doing it to make themselves happy. It's completely selfish,		Correct. But under utilitarianism, people's will doesn't matter, their happiness does. If both people end up happy, regardless of the person's *original wishes*, if they're happier otherwise that is considered the ethical decision.		>and also indicates a complete lack of respect for the other persons' wishes.		The interesting thing here is that the other person's wishes *change* to what you want them to be. Free will only exists to a certain extent. I can make you fall in love with me by looking and acting a certain way and setting off some feelings inside you- and that modifies your mindset and free will; I can make you fall in love with me by spraying you with a love potion, which has the same outcome. And that's the thing about utilitarianism, under that theory the *outcome* is the only thing that matters. You can argue that it's wrong based on other theories, but not utilitarianism. The only real difference here is that it's easier. Kinda reminds me of that one Redditor who read his friend's diary when they were both 16, to learn about ways he could get her to like him. It worked and now they're married and have 3 kids.Taking medication to improve your own mental state of your own free will is vastly different than someone forcing you to behave in a certain way, especially if that behavior is forcing you to fall in love with that person.
Yeah but if you're both blissfully in love forever after, what's the ultimate loss? Furthermore, true altruism doesn't really exist. Everybody does things to further their own interests in one way or another. And I would argue that inherent in hoping to make someone fall in love with you is the fact that once they are in love with you, you will get to make each other happy through your love. Mutual love is beneficial to both parties. So you don't count free will as any sort of loss?
In real life? No. In a stick figure web comic? Who gives a shit.Apparently a lot of people.

I'm on your side in this. Love potions are just as bad as slipping someone a roofie. Right, it's like a Jedi mind trick, or getting a Genie and wishing to read minds and then using what you know to get someone to fall for you. People really need to think rapey roofies when they see these tropes.
Oh you've got to be kidding, because its a "god of love" the blatant forced love is suddenly ok? What a fucking jokeCupid is supposed to represent our minds naturally falling in love with each other; he's an explanation for natural love more than an actual physical being. 		This comic is another human being drugging somebody else into loving him selfishly. You don't see how problems could come from painting that positively?

It's actually a relatively wide belief that Brave New World wouldn't be that bad, so no not necessarily. Like how wide are we talking about?
I think you can certainly make an argument that there is some beauty in sentient beings with free will... but as far as I'm concerned free will just leads to suffering. So it's okay for you to exercise your own free will, but not others?
Good thing this potion doesn't work by the same principle as cupid's arrow,  as that would make the whole argument moot.  I mean,  you **obviously** know,  probably from a peer-reviewed article,  that this potion is made from certain chemicals and works like drugs, instead of being made of love,  unicorn hair and piwnic tears collected by a virgin at moonlit hill, and just strengthening the feelings already presentBy definition, it's a potion that forces someone to love you. That's taking control of someone's free will. Cupid is just an explanation for how natural love occurs.

They were a mile into Liechtenstein before they realized their mistake.		>Swiss authorities informed Liechtenstein their border had been breached and the commanding officer gave an official apology.
make love, not war>During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Prince Johann II placed his soldiers at the disposal of the Confederation but only to defend the German territory of Tyrol. The Prince refused to have his men fight against other Germans. The Liechtenstein contingent took up position on the Stilfse Joch in the south of Liechtenstein to defend the Liechtenstein/Austrian border against attacks by the Italians under Garibaldi. A reserve of 20 men remained in Liechtenstein. When the war ended on July 22, the army of Liechtenstein marched home to a ceremonial welcome in Vaduz. Popular legend claims that 80 men went to war but 81 came back. Apparently an Austrian liaison officer joined up with the contingent on the way back.		I couldn't find a reliable source for this, but [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AHistory_of_Liechtenstein) is a thread on Wikipedia about it.

make love, not warOk so I dont think people realize how small of a country Lichtenstein is.		So theres the United States, and one of its smallish states is Ohio (Im talking land mass here). Its not huge but its not tiny so its a healthy shmedium.		One of this states larger cities is Cleveland, once again its not a huge city but its definatly not small.		About 45 minutes South of this is the smaller city of Akron. Definatly a small city. Theres like 3 skyscrapers and none of them are close to 80 stories tall or anything like that. Max id say is about 60 stories tall. But theres only three of them.		So then you drive another 20 minutes South of Akron and you get to a tiny little "city," called Green. This place has all of 2 streets in its own zip code the rest of it is a bunch of other cities zip codes. The only things we are known for is a Playboy bunny and an Olympic athlete from like half a century ago. The only time you would come here is to use our airport. Lichtenstein is only twice the size of this city (land mass) and has a population of only about 5,000 more people.		So yeah, its tiny.		Edit: Green has a population of about 30,000 people these days.

That's the thing, there are really no checkpoints inside EU (or more specifically countries of [Schengen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area)\) anymore. You don't need a passport, on most roads, there's usually just [a sign stating you are entering a different country](http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/4926138.jpg) and if crossing outside of roads, often you'll only realize you're in a different country by getting mobile signal from a foreign carrier :-D
Punish?I'm guessing for being born in the wrong place. We don't even *think* to extend our Constitutional rights for trial to foreigners(from less wealthy locations) before we bomb supposed threats and kill innocent citizens.

That's already the apparent standard attitude that allows this societal bystander effect to occur.
>with the German Confederation quashed.		Erm, didn't they win the war? Or does he mean that they weren't successful in Tyrol?As far as I remember, Austria didn't want to join Prussia in forming a united Germany. After the war, Prussia formed the North German Confederation. Only in 1871 did Germany unite but this was without Austria, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, all of which are majority German populated.

You kidding? On civ v? Build high and culture for the first half of the game until you get cho's and spam them for the upgrades. Then rush military techs (easy to do if you snag the right wonders) until you are a tech ahead of your neighbors and the world becomes Swiss cheese. Just steam roll through folks Yea double attacking archers early in the game is not compatible with "hard to win domination".  China is godtier in civ5  		Edit: and paper maker plus the generals bonus make midgame domination almost a sure bet. 
I can barely run 5 with shit graphics. Literally all that is saving me. Why is u porn alt on wholesomememes?
That's like driving from city to city in California.. In terms of distance covered, sure. In every other way, no. 		Belgium has amazing chocolate and a disdain for the French, whereas Germany has ... amazing chocolate and a disdain for the French, but in a totally different way. 
Schengen really is great, it can't happen everywhere but it's awesome for the people where it canHaha yeah, it's great isn't it? But just in case someone else in this thread doesn't know what Schengen is, could you explain?
>  But there are so many national borders in Europe it must be very easy to find yourself in the wrong country without even going through a checkpoint.		That's the thing, there are really no checkpoints inside EU (or more specifically countries of [Schengen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area)\) anymore. You don't need a passport, on most roads, there's usually just [a sign stating you are entering a different country](http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/4926138.jpg) and if crossing outside of roads, often you'll only realize you're in a different country by getting mobile signal from a foreign carrier :-DThe Finnish city of [Tornio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornio) and the Swedish city of [Haparanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haparanda) are basically one big city that spans the border. There's even an island in the middle of the river between the two countries where the border was diverted so that the island would be entirely in Finland (otherwise, it would have been about half and half).
I'm guessing for being born in the wrong place. We don't even *think* to extend our Constitutional rights for trial to foreigners(from less wealthy locations) before we bomb supposed threats and kill innocent citizens. That seems like a really arbitrarily defined punishment, if you as me.		I'm sure this may get downvoted, too, but I'm not wrong. I don't care that people would think I am, in fact. That's already the apparent standard attitude that allows this societal bystander effect to occur.> We don't even think to extend our Constitutional rights for trial to foreigners(from less wealthy locations) before we bomb supposed threats and kill innocent citizens.		To be fair, this is called "Imperialism" and is generally frowned upon in this day in age. Sovereign nations use border to define where each others' power ends. If you start saying a nation doesn't have sovereignty because it's "less wealthy" and take its territory and people under your reach, you open up for seizing the land and resources, or subjugating the people of any nation you can call "inferior".		When modern countries bomb people in other nations, it's with the permission of said nation, or under a declaration of war with it.
And I love fucking!And my axe! 
Just did a playthrough as the USSR in HOI3. I took turkey, romania, bulgaria, finland and hungary before 1941. Germany delayed barbarossa to July 1943 and when they finally invaded I had a better air force than them. They pushed me back roughly 15 miles and then it stalemated until I landed in Italy and took rome starting a new front. Then by December 1943 I had Rome, and by July 1944 I had berlin. The US also never went to europe and I successfully had Greece join my side. It was a heroic victory for StalinIn my games USSR just gets done fucked up by Germany because of the UNITED KINGDOM NOT DOING ANYTHING!!!
Haha yeah, it's great isn't it? But just in case someone else in this thread doesn't know what Schengen is, could you explain?It's the agreement which allows for unrestricted travel between the European countries meaning no border checkpoints nor visa requirement
Haha yeah, it's great isn't it? But just in case someone else in this thread doesn't know what Schengen is, could you explain?To expand on the previous commenter's response, not all EU countries are Schengen Area members and not all Schengen Area members are in the EU. You can see a list here: 		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area
In my games USSR just gets done fucked up by Germany because of the UNITED KINGDOM NOT DOING ANYTHING!!!Yeah dude they lost the invasion of normandy because they did it by myself, so when I hit nuke tech in January of 1946, I put one in london

Good on you, grandma!Most people wouldn't think about going out with their grandma to a pool party to get hammered and pick up girls.			But one thing many don't realize is your grandma is possibly the best wingman you will ever have. I am not joking at all. Hear me out.			1) First off, she doesn't give a fuck. She probably saw a war or two in her time and to her life is as precious as it is short. She will walk up to the crowd of the hottest girls by the pool, I am talking the girls you wouldn't dream of having the balls to talk to, and she will make sure they know who you are.				2) Now the hottest girls know who you are. She is pointing you out and you are a tad embarrassed. Well don't be. Fucking grandma will talk you up in a way women not only understand but highly appreciate. She isn't your best bud who is far too drunk and just tells them how nice and honest you are and how they should give you a chance, she is speaking in fucking women-tongue and they will be interested to talk to you regardless of what you look like or how shy you are.				3) She WANTS you to get laid. She wants you to find the hottest fucking most gorgeous girl around the pool/pub/bar/whatever because she wants her genes to be not only passed on, but passed UP the genetic lottery chain. She will do everything in her power to make sure her perfect little grandson is seeing a girl she is incredibly proud to say is now her granddaughter in law. She WANTS YOU TO GET LAID.				4) Women love a big and close family. My dad is a piece of shit but the reason my mom initially was attracted to him is because he appeared to have a very large and loving family. A family where the grandparents are always happy when you call and have nothing bad to say about you. This right here is a huge bonus to getting the gorgeous girl sunbathing across the pool to be interested in talking to you.				5) Grandma will never let a situation get dry. You are taking shots with grandma and 3 of the hottest girls you have ever seen all wearing a bikinis, likely never been in this situation and are kind of shy and don't know how to act. Well your grandma has you fucking covered. Situation grows silent, she will say something like "Do you want to hear the story of how my little Bizarrosparks when he was 5 asked out his teacher in kindergarten?" She will never let the conversation go dry because she doesn't give a fuck, she loves you to death, she wants you to succeed. And even if you don't, she believes you deserve to be with the most beautiful woman on the planet and will do everything in her power to make sure it happens.					Love you, grandma!

Wow, I was really expecting some copypasta here.		subbed /r/wholesomememes Welcome to the party! We all love each other here at /r/wholesomemes. Also, /u/BizarroSparkS is absolutely right about all this. BUT, he left out on of the most important points! And that is:		6) These beautiful girls are going to find your relationship with your grandma absolutely endearing, sweet, and wonderful! Most women appreciate (and sometimes seek out) family-oriented guys. And if a group of girls sees a guy poolside with his grandma, as opposed to his drunk buddies, they will see a guy who loves spending time with grandma more than having the more typical "young people fun". And that, my friends, is the type of guy they'll (probably) want to bring around their families!		Trust me, this works! I was on a date once where my grandma called me to chat. I told my date I had to take the call, because I NEVER ignore my grandparents. So i'm sitting on the phone with my grandma for 5 minutes, chatting, as I help her figure out what channel Supercross was on (my grandma is fucking awesome). So I'm Googling around for her, and talking on speaker phone. And, as always, I ended the call by telling my grandma that I loved her. (Always tell your grandma you love her!!!!)		My date later said that it was the most adorable thing she'd ever seen, and that it apparently made me 5 times more attractive. All because I took the time to talk to my grandma, and told her I loved her. (None of which was for show, obviously. That's how I always talk to my grandma.)
That subtle, "my dad's a piece of shit" in there. Don't know whether to laugh or cry. He sent me to get a paternity test when I was a young toddler because he didn't want to believe I was his. Then moved to a different country to avoid child support. Last I saw his Facebook said he had one son. It wasn't my name.
Dude......No idea what you are trying to imply here.
I definitely want to be this kind of grandma, but I'm afraid my son would disown me as his father if I did. Yea it sucks when your son won't be your father anymore.
I definitely want to be this kind of grandma, but I'm afraid my son would disown me as his father if I did. Solution: be your own Grandma.

I'll just call it the wedgie swimsuit.
I don't know what they're called, but they look straight out of the 80s with the super high hip holes. Hopefully women's hairstyles don't go back to the 80s too, or the ozone layer might be done for.I'm personally quite fine with these one pieces

It's funny how the photo gives the impression of a glamorous/fun life, but this video shows how mundane and normal the interaction was.I went to a spring break beach like this during college and it's a weird mix between every Spring Break Beach scene you see in movies (women flashing, bros shouting, people doing stupid stunts like climbing balconies for shots) and typical awkward college parties where everyone just drinks and stands around and has awkward meaningless drunk conversations on their way to sit with their friends.

Basically college parties with sand. Anakins hate it.Summer 2003, 17 years old, I went to Padre Island with my best friend and my dad. Had my first beer and decided it was a lot of fun. So the 2nd day I drew "party here" in the sand and hung out there all day. By the end of the night we had 20-30 strangers partying with us. Met some people who gave me beer, another guy invited us to his birthday party at a cabin behind us the following night, and 5 girls challenged me to remember all their names.		The next day we go to the house party. There's a naked girl skate boarding on the porch while a punk band plays. A girl pulled me into the laundry room and asked,"what do you want?" and one drunk guy fell off the balcony, twice. 		I got too drunk, told laundry girl no, and ran downstairs to vomit for my first time of alcohol abuse. My dad helped me to the tent where the 5 girls were just walking up, I recited their names then immediately passed out. My friend was at the party until 4, where naked skateboard girl let him drive her car even though he didn't have a license. He got mad at her and threw her car keys into the ocean.		Nothing ever that cool has ever happened again.
Such is party life.		In 20 years the fun will have worn off and some of them will be old saleswomen who can't close, and unhappy alcoholic spouses and mothers.		In some cases they'll gravitate toward trailer parks.  In others, jail.		The rest will be happy and successful, but mainly because they grew out of the lifestyle.You know, some people lead happy and successful lives, go to school/have a career and enjoy partying on their vacations and/or weekends. It's not automatically the trashy lifestyle you described (although it can be for some).
For some reason I presumed u/mhassig is a woman and was briefly very confused by both of the above comments...		*imagines grandpa in ripped hot pants and translucent blouse*My mom named me Morgan, I never stood a chance.

That's how you train your teamwork muscle!When I was training with my rugby team, we had a race in teams of 4 to squat 20000 pounds (You got one bar per team and could tag out as often as you wanted). How you set up the weights was up to your team of 4, but the race was reps*weights=20,000. You could change the weights if you wanted, but it was a time suck after you started. The winning team only used 45's on each side and just fucking went non stop like pistons. One team came in last because they were still arguing about how to load the bar after the clock started.

I'm not very good at running, but I joined the team because I liked it and needed to get into shape. For the distance team, the practices consisted of the instructors just letting us loose to run wherever we wanted most days. I had some friends on the team, so we ran in a group. Each day we would just run and talk, and by the end of the day we would have run a 10k. This was way farther than I thought I could run. All you need are some good friends and everything seems easier!

ReunionThis is almost violently wholesome.		How amazing to see two people share such a moment of unconditional completely unsexual love. Twice! The first time the love is coming from the guy, the second time from the woman. 
ReunionDo you think she joined JROTC because of him?
Reunion12 Fucking years? 
ReunionThe little girl in that picture is so cute it makes me angry.
ReunionI met the dude a number of times. He would visit us in BMT Medhold. That place is practically designed to murder your hopes and dreams, so him coming by was always a huge boost. The best days in there were when he would come in and just talk with us.		Very funny and good dude.
ReunionJROTC? That's highs school. Don't they mean ROTC. 
ReunionThis is awesome. Especially because his actions probably directly influenced her decision to join ROTC. Not "ooh rah 'Mericuhhh!" childish thoughts of killing bad guys, not some feeling of patriotic devotion, but a genuine desire to help others. He showed her what good the armed forces can do.
It's hard to believe it's been 12 years. Even harder to believe New Orleans is still dealing with the damage from it Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me.

I love how their smiles still look exactly the same <3It's funny, looking at the picture before the headline, my first thought was that they were father and daughter.
12 year later, just made E-7. 		There's Air Force advancement for you. Service before Self!
12 year later, just made E-7. 		There's Air Force advancement for you. many career fields in the AF move higher enlisted into supervisory and administrative roles which takes them out of operational activities.  Many of these ops guys put off being promoted so they don't get pulled from actually doing the job they quite literally dedicated their life to.  
12 year later, just made E-7. 		There's Air Force advancement for you. Says he's a vet
Looking at these two happy, smiling people makes me realize that time has ravaged my once youthful features. Why didn't I moisturize?!I'm sure you're still beautiful, because you're a wonderful person. :)
Looking at these two happy, smiling people makes me realize that time has ravaged my once youthful features. Why didn't I moisturize?!Don't fret! The effects may not be fully reversible but the impact can be lessened. Using a broad spectrum sunscreen and a lightweight moisturizer regularly can make a world of difference and don't take much primping time :)
That dude probably feels really old now.And is happy to see that this girl is getting the chance to grow older as well :D
That dude probably feels really old now.Still looks pretty young though. Got that going for him. 
That dude probably feels really old now.Except that time has stood still for him because he looks like he hasn't aged a day. 
That dude probably feels really old now.I feel really old just reading it.
It's so wholesome!And such a meme!
Air Force Pararescue men are ultimate bad assesMr. Maroney was cadre at the PJ school house for quite awhile. We call him the Abyss. One of the toughest, most genuine humans I've ever met.
Air Force Pararescue men are ultimate bad assesDad was a PJ, can attest
Do you think she joined JROTC because of him?Could be!
JROTC? That's highs school. Don't they mean ROTC. Maybe she's in JROTC? 
JROTC? That's highs school. Don't they mean ROTC. If she was 5 in the initial photo (although I don't spend much time with kids so I'm probably bad at estimating ages), she'd be 17 now and still in high school
JROTC? That's highs school. Don't they mean ROTC. A military ball is something every JROTC battalion has to at least attempt to have every year, servicemen are commonly invited to these events.  I assume the airmen here was accepting an invite and took this girl as his +1.  Source: was in JROTC in highschool 
He hasn't aged a day.Yeah, he's aged 12 years instead.
*Iconic?!* I'm not being cynical. I've never seen this photo before in my life. 		Edit: I regret giving anybody the impression that I wasn't being wholesome by wondering where this photo came from. I see now the error of my ways. Gee wiz, Katrina was terrible. Hey there friendo, keep in mind "iconic" is subjective, it may not be iconic to you, but it may be to the majority of others. There is nothing wrong with that. You just missed it or don't remember and that's ok!

Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. Bits and pieces of New Orleans east still have a lot of empty land where there used to be houses. Honestly at this point the biggest effect isn't property any more as it is the population loss and the legacy the storm had for the city. Lots of suicides, loss of business, death of family members etc 
Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. Whole communities were displaced from New Orleans. Thousands of the city's poorest residents were uprooted and relocated to nearby cities (Houston took many, I believe) and many haven't moved back. The rebound of some areas (mostly white and middle/upper middle class) and complete dilapidation of others (mostly black and lower class) has fanned racial and economic tensions. As is sadly too frequent, politicians are riding the tide for election purposes and doing very little to bring people together.
Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. Hey I'm not trying to take away the thunder from New Orleans, but they weren't the only area hit and by no means were they hit the worst.		My home town of Pass Christian MS had a 36 foot tidal surge and my home had 26ft of water in it. My home is a mile off of the beach.		Just in our little coastal town, roughly 85% of businesses were completely destroyed. Our middle school and elementary school were turned to complete rubble, as was most of the rest of the town.		I worked for a missions organization for roughly 2 years rebuilding homes, feeding homeless displaced by the storm, and doing events to bring the community together.		The last home I helped rebuild was 3 years ago. The old woman who lived there didn't have insurance and was forced to use all of her saved up retirement money on an old motor home just so she could stay in the area she loved.		Don't get me wrong, new Orleans still needs help, but there were other places that got absolutely destroyed and no one ever found out about it.

Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. Depends how you define effected. There are hundred of thousands of poor, mostly black people that didn't return to the city. Those are entire neighborhoods and cultures and all the connections they represented, all their contributions to the place lost. There are areas that haven't been rebuilt because the people didn't come back and/or the ones still there aren't important enough to rebuild. Then there are the wealthier areas that gained new territory in the city and no longer had to deal with having the poor and rundown bordering their dream version of NO. If you Google it you will see this spread and the accompaning gentrification. You will read about a rebounding NO and the underdog story of its rebuilding efforts. People will champion how much progress has been made while ignoring those hundreds of thousands that can't return to what they once had. 
Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. I went down there for Mardi Gras and it went from richer beach house to desolate areas. I remember seeing a huge building that didn't have a window that was intact. Houses are still abandoned, overgrown yards and run down houses. Im sure you know of a few places that are like this.
I mean, to be honest things are pretty normal. No one is really dealing with it anymore, a lot of people think it's ridiculous that people bring it up every time they hear New Orleans. Not true, Katrina still affects our state to this day. Lots of blight and infrastructure hasn't fully come back. Our state has had too many problems and not enough money or resources to deal with it.

Maybe he made E7 years ago. Maybe he is a vetHe is a vet. He did 19 years before he was forced to leave the air force due to medical problems. Couldn't even get 1 more year to retire with benefits.

I'm sure you're still beautiful, because you're a wonderful person. :)Haha that is probably the nicest thing anyone's said to me in 2017. You're a wonderful person for making a stranger's day better! Thanks!
And is happy to see that this girl is getting the chance to grow older as well :DYeah i imagine that reunion was a high point for him too since, well just thinking about it, at the time he was saving the girl's future and now he gets to appreciate 12 years of that future.

Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?Really depends on the neighborhood. But generally, no. Most "new houses" are made in mind to withstand another hurricane, especially those in the 9th ward that were built by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's foundation. It sounds wacky, but a lot of community time and effort went into the new structures there. In other parts of the city, where "new structure" is just due to gentrification, who knows. But generally, New Orleans is very strict when it comes to demolishing our historic buildings for new ones unless the old ones were already destroyed. 		Here's an example: http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/17/12/2B6CA1EC00000578-3200488-image-a-5_1439810377015.jpg
Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?One, foundations are not and were never the problem.		And two, in a flood risk area, I'd take a wood frame house on wooden stilts over a ground level house made entirely of solid concrete. 		It wasnt the hurricane that did the majority of the damage. It was the flooding caused by the hurricane.  
Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?Dude a little bit of brick and concrete is not going to stop 200 mph winds and 10-30 feet of flooding. All bricks in regards to tornadoes and hurricanes are just heavier debris. Have you never watched what storms are capable of?		From another [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3kvge8/eli5why_are_houses_in_parts_of_the_us_seem_to_be/cv13by8/), [this is what an EF4 tornado did to a brick school](http://dataomaha.com/media/pilger/damage-map/images/school-after.jpg). 
Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?When I went down to help with cleanup most houses were perfectly intact structurally, just too moldy to live in and too expensive to get cleaned.		3 feet of water sitting in your house for weeks will do that.
Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?The foundation or building materials of a house matter infinitely less than the fact that most homes are built on unstable, soft ground and are below sea-level.

Every person I know that survived Katrina in New Orleans never moved back. They all lost their homes and didn't have the ability to rebuild. I just want to learn more about this. Did the insurance companies not payout for the houses lost? I thought you were required to have flood and hurricane coverage in areas that are prone to those disasters.
Really? Not Alabama? When I was 8 a group of drunk 40 year olds insulted, flipped me off, and threatened to hit me because I was wearing a UT jacket. Still haven't quite gotten past it. UT? Is that a college? Still, the fact that they thought it was worth insulting you over is very fucked up.

TIL they deployed PJs to assist in the Katrina rescue operations Yep. "Former Pararescue." At least they finally got a mission. It takes a lot of things going wrong to have to send out a PJ, but when they do, that's exactly who you need. They operate almost exclusively in clusterfucks.
yea i thought it was weird myself. whatever floats his boat i guessIt's not weird - he was battling PTSD, and his rescuing her, and that fond memory helped him keep his mental wellbeing together.

I just want to learn more about this. Did the insurance companies not payout for the houses lost? I thought you were required to have flood and hurricane coverage in areas that are prone to those disasters.The answer to this is extremely complex. Because the federal government insures against disasters, and people also had insurance on their homes and belongings, some people ended up double dipping and getting more than they needed, some people inevitably got fucked. 		And let me ask you this, would you rebuild in new Orleans? 
I just want to learn more about this. Did the insurance companies not payout for the houses lost? I thought you were required to have flood and hurricane coverage in areas that are prone to those disasters.The TL;DR of it is that many people couldn't afford to wait for the payouts from the feds, state, and insurance companies. 		It was cheaper to uproot and move out of the city and immediate metro (Westbank, Metairie, Kenner, LaPlace). That's why places like Covington and Slidell saw a population boom following Katrina. 
UT? Is that a college? Still, the fact that they thought it was worth insulting you over is very fucked up. University of Texas, yeah. Alabama people fans are *rabid* when it comes to football. 
What's the good news from Alabama?		No really, does anything good happen there?Well we have a moonpie that we drop on New Year's Eve 		If that's good news for you. I know it is for me.

Because the federal government insures against disasters, and people also had insurance on their homes and belongings, some people ended up double dipping and getting more than they needed, some people inevitably got fucked. 		And let me ask you this, would you rebuild in new Orleans? I'm from Covington, about 40 miles north of New Orleans in the Metro. It took 18+ months for FEMA to give us a trailer and took a year to get the grants from the Road Home fund. That doesn't even include insurance payouts which took an eternity to get according to my parents. I don't remember the exact details because I was a kid at the time. 		Simply put many people didn't want to wait or couldn't afford to wait the months or years to rebuild, so they just uprooted and moved out of the city.

I've got a 2nd interview today. What color sock should I wear?My wife is a corporate controller, and she has a team of accountants that work under her.

Thanks. I'm going to be applying for new jobs soon  and I'm nervous about it, but this helps. I'll remember to get real pooffy. :) As someone who has interviewed hundreds of people, if not thousands, for both entry level and management positions, let me just say that being nervous is allowed.  As long as you're not sweating through your jacket, a little bit of nervousness usually shows that you place a high level of importance on the interview and the job, and it's better than the people who act like they don't care about the interview. 		Protip, if you find yourself fumbling a bit because of your anxiety, acknowledge it to the interviewer.  A quick "I'm sorry, I'm excited about this position, and I'm a bit nervous," shows self-awareness and an ability to admit faults. You can even take a minute to compose yourself if that's what's needed.  Some great employees are bad at interviewing, and most interviewer are fully aware of this. 		Be yourself, don't worry too much, and you'll do great.

Do you by chance play animal crossing? :3I do, it's probably my favorite Nintendo series.
Huh.		Thought that Brewster was an owl.Nope. He's good friends with Blathers though, who is an owl. That's why (until New Leaf) he was in the museum basement. Even in NL, blathers is the one that suggests you build the roost for him.		He also puts "pigeon milk" into your coffee if you become good enough friends with him. In real life pigeon milk is pigeon puke of some sort, but I guess it tastes sweet.
That sounds like Tom Bombadil.Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;		Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.
What about blue then? :) What about black thigh highs and no pants?

It's just a super sweet escape from the barrage of hatred and negativity that most of us encounter everywhere else.

Actually while you were asleep politics based subreddits have taken over and Trump won.Darkness cannot extinguish darkness, only light can do that. Trolling cannot extinguish trolling, only /r/wholesomememes can do that
Actually while you were asleep politics based subreddits have taken over and Trump won.Seriously though, it's usually a bad idea to get your politics from from public commenting places, specially Reddit and specially hyper-partisan subreddits like /r/politics. The most upvoted submissions will always be the most striking, and you'll end up more angry than informed whichever your political leanings are. 		I feel that this is a big lesson everyone should have learned last year. 
Actually while you were asleep politics based subreddits have taken over and Trump won.Eh, politics posts seem to be on a slight downturn lately. Like, a week, two weeks ago they'd be literally 75% of /r/all/hot/ all day long, even if the news was like, "a blogger noticed something in an old transcript". 		Still, I feel like /r/wholesomememes heyday was even earlier, like right after the election. Now we've just stabilized.

Maybe it's the Baader-Meinhoff effect, but nonetheless I'm happy because of it, and I'm probably not alone in that!

True happiness is finding a stranger cat that wants pets. I just moved to a new house. One of my first days walking from the bus stop, I saw a GIANT albino cat behind some shrubs. I stood in front of it, and he leaped over them, walked up to me, and stood up, with his front paws on my leg. Got up to nearly my waist. Asking for pets and after said pets were given, he walked home with me, just a slow wander. When we got there, he rolled over and I gave him some belly rubs. I then went inside and got a treat for him, after which he wandered off home. I see him every week or so and we do the same thing. Don't know who's cat, where he lives, or anything, but I like our friendship.

If it makes you feel better, puffins are doing just fine in Iceland. > The population in Iceland and Norway, which together account for 80% of the European population, decreased markedly since the early 2000s (BirdLife International 2015).

I always wanted to be part of the cool people club in 3rd grade :(Well guess what, you can be part of the cool people club as a grown-up, and that club is way better than the cool kids club in the third grade.
They were an adorable and photogenic pest in Newfoundland when I lived there. Like classy seagullsThey really are classy birds. They're social, nice to other bird species, take very good care of their chicks, and even mate for life.
I went to the same place. Maybe it was just how it was prepared, but I found it to be oily and smoky. Maybe a little like duck, but more tender. It was really goodI think they may have meant ethically.
They serve cow and pig all over the place too. I really wish more places would start moving to proper alternatives. I'm with you for different reasons.  I cringe when people treat animals differently based on whether they're cute which is why I'm ok with cats and horses showing up on menus.		At least be consistent.  I respect your choices.
idk why but whale blubber sounds disgusting, also I dont think we should be eating whales.No reason not to. They're nowhere near endangered.  	Edit: It saddens me that people are so ignorant about whaling in northern Europe. Mink whales are the only type of whales being hunted, which there are buttloads of. If you disagree with eating them you might as well stay away from all fish.. Or animals for that matter. 
I feel like I knew this in my heart but I didn't want to believe it.		I want to be angry at you for stealing my innocence, but you are a straight shooter and I respect that. You are great.If every dimension exists, there's one in which this is true, if that helps. There's even a dimension where this little puffin falls in love with one of the decoys, and then it magically comes to life and they have little puffinettes of their own. 
I think "might have" stood on one leg regardless. If it's something they do all the time they're more likely, true, but if they're social then I can imagine it be almost a contagious suggestion kinda thing like yawning too. Definitely a social thing. My last pair of budgies were really close and I got to observe their mutual antics all the time! Theyd watch one another and preen the same side of their wings at the same time, shake off the same time, eat the same foods, bathe, etc, as a pair. Mirror neurons are cool as hell. I'd def believe that a bird is trying to befriend another they'd be comfortable copying position and acitivity.
Where did the raised ones go??I can't remember the results of any banding. But after they fledge, puffins spend years at sea. There was one small colony of puffins still extant in Maine at the time on an island near a lighthouse, but only because of human intervention. I believe at least one of the transplanted puffins was seen there before Egg Rock was finally recolonized.		If you search for Steve Kress you'll find the whole story. I volunteered one summer at the Hog Island Audubon camp but that was a few years ago so my memory is spotty.

Nah, flamingos stand on one leg all the time to conserve body heatBut maybe they were taught by this duck, and the idea just spread around because it was useful. 
Nah, flamingos stand on one leg all the time to conserve body heatTheir little spindly legs don't look strong enough to support them. Funny little creatures. 
Nah, flamingos stand on one leg all the time to conserve body heatAccording to whatever zoo I went to last, it's not known for sure why they do this, but the best theory is temperature regulation. So sometimes they have both legs in the water and sometimes just one.		When I'm too hot for the covers but too cold for no covers, I put one leg under and one leg over and I call it flamingoing.
Nah, flamingos stand on one leg all the time to conserve body heatI'm pretty sure they stand on one leg because if they didn't, they'd fall over.
Nah, flamingos stand on one leg all the time to conserve body heatWhy not stand on no legs?
Nah, flamingos stand on one leg all the time to conserve body heatThey stand on one leg so that if the water they're standing in is stuck by lightning they won't be electrocuted.  
This isn't going to be another dolphin experiment, is it?No, a flamingo experiment. It's a common mistake as they are both roundish and have pointy faces. Don't take it too hard on yourself. 
Did you get a kiss from Poseidon in return?... You don't lay down a safety square before to break the surface tension?
Calm down there, this is r/wholesomememes and I'm sure that site wasn't great but they commented to show us some fantastic ducks anyway possible and I appreciate their effortApparently there were some gross ads on the site but I didn't see them thanks to adblock.

Well guess what, you can be part of the cool people club as a grown-up, and that club is way better than the cool kids club in the third grade.When I was in 3rd grade I was invited to the pen 15 club.

Well guess what, you can be part of the cool people club as a grown-up, and that club is way better than the cool kids club in the third grade.Adult cool people club serves beer.
Toucans are terrifying. What if it tried to eat you with that huge beak? They mainly eat fruit, but in theory are omnivores. 		Still, the beak is not dangerous at all. While huge, it's also very light and their bite is really weak (your average budgie probably has a stronger bite).		A toucan owner made a post on reddit some time ago and I did some research. Apparently they make great pets, as they are really social and not aggressive at all. But they are also extremly expensive and a lot of work, because they are very smart and social and also need a lot of space and fresh, exotic fruit.
They really are classy birds. They're social, nice to other bird species, take very good care of their chicks, and even mate for life.See the Irish cartoon Puffin Rock on Netflix for even more puffin wholesomeness!		(Thanks to a previous reddit post I feel obliged to add that, no really, that's not a euphemism. It really is about a family of puffins and their adventures and it's extremely adorable.)

I'm with you for different reasons.  I cringe when people treat animals differently based on whether they're cute which is why I'm ok with cats and horses showing up on menus.		At least be consistent.  I respect your choices.Definitely. I eat meat and I think its hyprocritical to be 'shocked' about cute animals on the menu. Cows and pigs are damn cute as well, if you ever met one! And even if they weren't, they're animals just the same.
No reason not to. They're nowhere near endangered.  	Edit: It saddens me that people are so ignorant about whaling in northern Europe. Mink whales are the only type of whales being hunted, which there are buttloads of. If you disagree with eating them you might as well stay away from all fish.. Or animals for that matter. Most species of whales are actually endangered, so there's definitely a reason not to eat them.

Although just as there's rampant fraud in fish labeling, there are mix-ups - actually endangered whales have turned up mislabeled in the meat market when whale meat has been DNA tested.   And it's all very hard to tell, so it persists.   	Not trying to judge, but saying it's never harmful isn't 100% true either.  There's got to be a balance between sustaining cultural rights, while recognizing it's not without cost to endangered species also.

What a cool restaurant! :)I thought this was an unwholesome post about how your sister was too dull to realize that her menu was not a tablet. This post was wholesome the whole time. Happy for you guys!
What a cool restaurant! :)Truth is most corporate places probably have a braille menu in their initial inventory when they open, it just ends up in a storage closet/filing cabinet after a number of years and numerous management turnovers.
What a cool restaurant! :)I love this. It annoys me how few places care about making their shit accessible.		I work for a largehuge Evil Government Agency. My giant EGA just last year launched a system where people who needed to contact us could get in touch with an ASL agency worker. 		For those who unfamiliar, if you're deaf you may have to go through a video service to get your phone calls done. While this service is invaluable, it is also slow, expensive, and there are often gaps in understanding as you have to rely on the translator to get what you need said across.		Having an employee instead speak directly to the ASL person is a LOT faster, and results in way higher levels of comprehension. Virtually every American will have to deal with my agency *several times* in their life. This means we deal with a heck of a lot of people who are blind, deaf, or have other issues. I think it is sad that it was only 2016 when we finally decided "hey maybe we can help our deaf friendos directly!"
What a cool restaurant! :)This will speak very terrible of me, but here goes:		About 20 years ago McDonalds began offering braille menus (I believe to comply with the ADA). So on a lunch break at college, my friend and went to the local McDonalds. I screwed up my eyes and walked to the counter, and asked for the Braille menu. One eye was looking at my nose and the other was looking off in the distance.		The guy gave me the menu (they had them in a container off to the side of the counter; we had seen them in a previous visit).		I slid my hand across the braille, and then acted excited, and said "I'll have two of the 10 cent big macs please!". The guy at the counter was confused and said they were 1.89.		"no," I said, pointing to the menu. "Read it... it says right here they are 10 cents!"		But I couldn't keep it up, and started giggling... and the guy just gave me a dirty look.		Probably going to hell for it.		I'm so glad OP's sis found a restaurant that had a menu that she could read!

I bet they spent a lot of money on that one menu that was used once. Awesome of them, but I bet a braille single menu for your little restaurant costs a bunch. That depends on a few factors. If you have a frequently changing menu, then you likely have to pick up your own Braille embosser which will cost in the thousands of dollars. If your menu is more set in stone, then you can just print from a commercial printer which won't be bad if you have a place with an embosser, and if not then you can likely get something online.

Hey, just so you know, there's no reason to use an apostrophe to pluralize the word menu. What the restaurant could barely afford was menus, not menu's. That was a really wholesome way to educate someone on a common grammar mistake! I hope your next burrito doesn't explode. 
Hey, just so you know, there's no reason to use an apostrophe to pluralize the word menu. What the restaurant could barely afford was menus, not menu's. My man, fighting the good fight. There's been a surge in the number of people using an apostrophe for any word that ends in an s and it's driving me nuts.
I think I'd be happier about the situation requiring one of those than the other...One can involve smores 
I doubt it really cost that much, ops picture is just a binder and the pages can be printed from a braille printer. The harder part would just be finding a print company that offer it. Might even be cheaper than the ones custom made with leather etcPerhaps a while ago it would have been tough but there are a lot of online services now where you can just send them a PDF and you'll get a high quality bound Braille print. 		Technology can be quite wonderful at times. 
I'm sorry for your loss LOL to your family.
Breakfast food, imho. They make good pancakes and warm up the syrup for you. Biscuits are pretty decent, too :) Mostly tho, they're good because they're just about everywhere in the US and you'll always know what you're getting. They make a point of working more from scratch than most other chain restaurants.For lunch food, I always go with the chicken fried chicken (sic) with fried okra and mac n cheese. That's some real comfort food for me.
Don't get the food, just get sunglasses and a keychain and one of those really long spirally lollipops from the gift shop.My mom made the mistake of letting me buy a harmonica at a Cracker Barrel when I was a kid. The only instructions were notes for "When the saints go marching in." That's also the only thing I ever learned to play. She and the dog hated it. And probably the neighbors too.
Your douchebag ex can suck 19 dicks for keeping you from the crickle darrelWhat is happening with these comments
Also, the machines are usually the same models that they use for walk-up ATMs - no point in building one with braille and one without.Ah shit deja vu from just a week ago the same exact thread by comment..

That was a really wholesome way to educate someone on a common grammar mistake! I hope your next burrito doesn't explode. That's a very thoughtful thing to wish for someone. It's a shame when the burrito explodes and you have to finish the rest with a spoon.

That's a very thoughtful thing to wish for someone. It's a shame when the burrito explodes and you have to finish the rest with a spoon.Hey, just so you know, you can usually keep your burrito from exploding by slowly unraveling the foil or wrapping on your burrito as you eat it, which will also aide in containing its contents in case the tortilla has structural failure and has a side burst. Also, a fork may be more effective than a spoon. In any case, enjoy your burrito!

Can't deny that sparkA study found that animals often make assessments about human attractiveness and are influenced by it, preferring contact with humans they find physically attractive, although behavior and scent figured in somehow as well. Their tastes, coincidentally or not, happen to not be very different from our own. It seems standards of physical beauty may be universal. 		I do remember them saying red or blonde hair and fair skin rate very highly, so maybe there's good cause for that little guy to look so smitten.

Partners in crimeDamn, every single day it's like my mistakes keep getting beaten into me more and more.		I've only had one girlfriend. I'm not too popular with the opposite sex, but whatever. I gave up on that stuff years ago. Too much effort.		But with her I was actually happy. I'm a huge Batman fan, and early on in our relationship she bought us matching "Partners in Crime" Batman bracelets. I'm not a bracelet guy by any means, but it was sweet. I wore it every day religiously, even if we weren't gonna see each other.		I worked my ass off that year to graduate - packed three years of school into four months of online classes. I was exhausted and at the end of my rope. And then she didn't want to go to my graduation, after all that work. So I left. I didn't even say anything. I ghosted her. Didn't talk to her for years. I felt justified.		I texted her on New Years to apologize for leaving. She's not even mad. She forgave me. She's wanted me to come back ever since. I came back two months too late, though. She's with somebody else now. More successful than I'll probably ever be, at the rate I'm going. Even being my shittiest and most petty she forgave me. I should have just talked to her about it.		Sorry guys. Just kinda got triggered by this and needed to vent. Been happening too much recently.

My favorite kinds of meeting stories are the ones where there was just NOTHING to indicate they would ever get on well.  Not a bad interaction, but like they had some bizarre, one off interaction and parted ways, and then years later they get married.		I met my husband when I was 16 and he was 18. I was working at a roller skating rink and the owners wanted me to run the snack bar for a speed skating meet. Doors opened at like 5 am but it sounded fun so I agreed. My husband was one of the competitors and I served him food but didn't think much of him other than him being a customer. He started coming in occasionally when I worked and continued to buy food. He also kept putting a lot of change in the donation jar on the counter which was labeled for some cause. Apparently he was using that as an excuse to come up and talk to me. Eventually his cousin asked me for my AIM screen name (I'm really dating myself now). He messaged me through AIM and we became friends. The rest is history, 14 years later. 
My favorite kinds of meeting stories are the ones where there was just NOTHING to indicate they would ever get on well.  Not a bad interaction, but like they had some bizarre, one off interaction and parted ways, and then years later they get married.		*Story time!* Sounds like me and bf. We were in the same French class in junior year and for the first half year, never spoke. The second half, we were supposed to put on a show and we were in different set design groups that ended up working together at the same slot on the last weekend. I burned myself with a glue gun and he, making fun of me all the way, walked me to the nurse to get bandaged. He added me on Facebook that night and for the next two weeks we couldn't stop talking to each and extend 24/7 almost. He hinted he wanted me to ask him to the "girls ask guys" dance and I did and he said yes. Two weeks and a couple of group dates together and he asked me to be his gf.  	We dated for 3 months and then broke up because our whole meeting + getting to know each other + dating happened in no more than 2.5 weeks.  	9 months later (yea, it's a weird number) in the beginning of February we met again at a show that we were both in. We talked for a good month and the whole time I kept getting vibes that he wanted to try again.  	On Valentine's Day, he asked me in passing of he wanted to hang out that night. I honestly figured that it was going to be a group hangout but it turned out he had actually asked me out and we ended up studying together at Dennys. We kept messing around and not focusing on work so we figured we'd just call it a night and head to his house to watch a movie. I picked a scary movie (not sure why, but I guess younger me knew what I was doing); Grudge 3, I think. And we cuddled (sort of) under a blanket. I was trying to be respectful and not force myself on him in case I was actually reading the signs wrong. He, though, kept purposely bumping my hand like he was "fixing" the blanket but he kept doing it so I took a breath and held his hand. And I could feel us both collectively freeze cuz we knew what that meant. And then he grabbed my hand more. A little while later he just turned to me and kissed me and asked if I wanted to try again. I said yes and 4 years later, here we are :) We're planning on moving in together in a year or so. I'm kind of proud of our little story because it's something out of movie. Hehehe thanks for reading this, if you made it so far! I'd love to hear of any more meet up stories :))

She had asked a mutual friend to get her a burger from the burger joint by school before practice but the friend had declined, instead telling her to ask me. So she did and I said I'd join her. While we were there she had actually called me her girlfriend in a joking way and a few months later we started dating.

We knew each other over 10 years ago in high school. He was older than me and we only sort of knew each other. He taunted me a bit. He was actually partially responsible for my ex in highschool asking me out. Fast forward 10 years and we see each other on Tinder. His opening line is "I am like 90% sure I know you from highschool." From that day on we couldn't stop talking and now we live together!

Not a bad interaction, but like they had some bizarre, one off interaction and parted ways, and then years later they get married.		This is me and my current girlfriend!!  		She was mutual friends with a band mate in my shitty garage band back in high school 12 years ago.  We hung out several times that summer and I thought she was really cute, but I had a "serious" girlfriend at the time and she had a boyfriend.  We parted ways as the next school year started and basically forgot about each other.  		Fast forward to last year...we happened to randomly reconnect and hit it off, and when we made the connection of our mutual friend and name-dropped my old band, my jaw about hit the floor.  		Since then it's developed into the best relatioship I've ever had.  I'm genuinely excited at the prospect of potentially spending the rest of my life with such a goofy, intelligent, caring, incredible girl.  
yes you can!		i believe in you... but I can't even!
yes you can!		i believe in youJUST DO IT! MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE!		In all seriousness, you'll find your own partner in crime and you can safely do crimes in GTA if need be
Step 1:  Be attractive.Step 2: Just be you
Step 1:  Be attractive.Step 2: Realize that a nice personality makes you attractive =)
Step 1:  Be attractive.I know a guy who looks weird. He also talks weird. He's quiet and awkward. But he's so in ownership of who he is, and is 100% unashamed of the corny shit he likes and the corny artwork he does, that he's been dating a beautiful, *nice* woman for two years now 
Step 1:  Be attractive.Attractive is in the eye of the beholder. My guy isn't attractive by society's standards, but he's the most beautiful man alive to me. I'll take someone corny, funny and kind over someone superhot one any day of the week. 
Yeeah it's more like:		>I got paired with a super hot guyDifferent people find different things attractive. Your perfect 10 is not my perfect 10, and so on. The best thing you can do is to constantly be improving yourself (I don't mean just appearance, I mean make yourself a better person in other ways) and put yourself out there w/r/t dating. Just go out, meet people, be casual. When something serious is ready to happen, it'll happen. 		Insisting that the only reason this worked out is because the guy is super hot is silly - he might not even be conventionally attractive for one, and his personality is very obviously what made her go for him. 
Yeeah it's more like:		>I got paired with a super hot guyI  don't like the cynicism but it's not inaccurate. 
First, you gotta be "super hot" super		HOT		super		HOT
me: aw they're sweet together! 	me: wow she's only 22! 		me: *cries softly stroking a cat* I'm 23 and in a healthy, happy committed relationship and the prospect of getting engaged just made me break out in a cold sweat. 
Here's the tissue for your grass allergy I've got a case of onions! 
You will find a /u/missus_bmwilliams to share your love with, just keep doing you friend.		P.S.--I tried tagging that username to see if there was a quick way to find her, but page not found.  Darn."User not found" Story of my life  thanks though
I sincerely hope it's real.Why is everyone thinking this might not be real? I met my fianc back when we were in high school after making a shitty joke to her in Chemistry. 
Chillax friend. The time will come when you least expect it. Don't think about marrying so much.			Marriage is nothing without everlasting love and the dedication for care from both of you.Thank you :)
I've been with my girl for 8 and I'm only now looking for a ring. Congrats, my dude, best of luck to you! 
If you really want to marry him, propose to him. Don't let tradition hold you back.A study at USC showed ~~99% (maybe 100%?) of men who participated do not want their partners to propose.~~ 83% of male participants would prefer to propose. That's a pretty liberal/progressive sample, too. Food for thought.
I'm sorry friend. RIP to him/her and hopefully you can move on for a better life. I'm sure he/she is up there loving you so much still.He/She may have just broken up

And even damning that it's pretty original and clever. Even if it was fake, it's not outside the realm of possibility. It'd be more /r/thathappened material if it ended with the classic "and everyone stood up and clapped" ending, but this is pretty damn believable.As they say in Italian: "Se non  vero,  ben trovato" - if it isn't true, it's 'well made-up'.

It'd be more /r/thathappened material if it ended with the classic "and everyone stood up and clapped" ending, but this is pretty damn believable.But if it was just some hot guy she got paired up with for a project and that was their first encounter, why were they changing their contacts instead of creating them? 
Yeah, but to come back and post in yohr tumblr or whatever just seems farfetched. How??? Do you not realize that a lot of people would think that this is romantic? This is how social media is used. If you make a post about a hot guy and then end up marrying him I think a most people would want to look up that old post and do this. It's supercommon, totally normal and considered romantic.

Hey friend, don't dispair! My future husband made me smile first. Then I discovered that the more he made me laugh, the better looking he got. Keep them laughing, you'll just get better looking!Pro tip: worked on me with my wife, too. That is, she made me laugh and got sexier in the process.

I met my husband when I was 16 and he was 18. I was working at a roller skating rink and the owners wanted me to run the snack bar for a speed skating meet. Doors opened at like 5 am but it sounded fun so I agreed. My husband was one of the competitors and I served him food but didn't think much of him other than him being a customer. He started coming in occasionally when I worked and continued to buy food. He also kept putting a lot of change in the donation jar on the counter which was labeled for some cause. Apparently he was using that as an excuse to come up and talk to me. Eventually his cousin asked me for my AIM screen name (I'm really dating myself now). He messaged me through AIM and we became friends. The rest is history, 14 years later. This is so cute thank you for sharing.  Put a smile on my face :)
*Story time!* Sounds like me and bf. We were in the same French class in junior year and for the first half year, never spoke. The second half, we were supposed to put on a show and we were in different set design groups that ended up working together at the same slot on the last weekend. I burned myself with a glue gun and he, making fun of me all the way, walked me to the nurse to get bandaged. He added me on Facebook that night and for the next two weeks we couldn't stop talking to each and extend 24/7 almost. He hinted he wanted me to ask him to the "girls ask guys" dance and I did and he said yes. Two weeks and a couple of group dates together and he asked me to be his gf.  	We dated for 3 months and then broke up because our whole meeting + getting to know each other + dating happened in no more than 2.5 weeks.  	9 months later (yea, it's a weird number) in the beginning of February we met again at a show that we were both in. We talked for a good month and the whole time I kept getting vibes that he wanted to try again.  	On Valentine's Day, he asked me in passing of he wanted to hang out that night. I honestly figured that it was going to be a group hangout but it turned out he had actually asked me out and we ended up studying together at Dennys. We kept messing around and not focusing on work so we figured we'd just call it a night and head to his house to watch a movie. I picked a scary movie (not sure why, but I guess younger me knew what I was doing); Grudge 3, I think. And we cuddled (sort of) under a blanket. I was trying to be respectful and not force myself on him in case I was actually reading the signs wrong. He, though, kept purposely bumping my hand like he was "fixing" the blanket but he kept doing it so I took a breath and held his hand. And I could feel us both collectively freeze cuz we knew what that meant. And then he grabbed my hand more. A little while later he just turned to me and kissed me and asked if I wanted to try again. I said yes and 4 years later, here we are :) We're planning on moving in together in a year or so. I'm kind of proud of our little story because it's something out of movie. Hehehe thanks for reading this, if you made it so far! I'd love to hear of any more meet up stories :))I read it all! This is the most cutest post that I have ever read here on Reddit.

Be a 7This whole number thing bugs me for any gender. Like the sum of your existence or how you appear to different people can be assigned a single number. That's just sad for anyone who reduces a person to one digit on a scale they've made up.		People aren't discrete digits- we are more like... poems. That's a form most people would agree doesn't have a judge, rather an appreciation. Some people may like the form but not the content, others may like the content but not the form. Some may fall in love with both, some may not be into either. Some poems take a while to read or to absorb, some are short or easy to get, but they've all got something to express as part of language.

"User not found" Story of my life  thanks thoughI'm right here my love.	
Why is everyone thinking this might not be real? I met my fianc back when we were in high school after making a shitty joke to her in Chemistry. It is. She posted a photo of them and her Tumblr is regularly updated
A study at USC showed ~~99% (maybe 100%?) of men who participated do not want their partners to propose.~~ 83% of male participants would prefer to propose. That's a pretty liberal/progressive sample, too. Food for thought.That's a misreading of the study.		http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/01/marriage-traditions.html		>not one of 136 men surveyed believed  "I would definitely want my partner to propose"		but		>Nearly 15 percent of men answered, "I would kind of want to propose" and 16.9 percent said, "It doesn't matter who proposes."		In other words, nearly 1 in 3 of the men questioned would have been fine with the woman proposing, though, granted, nearly half of those would be somewhat disappointed by it.		Edit: I should add that even among the men who chose the option "I would definitely want to propose," that doesn't mean they're necessarily opposed to the idea of the woman proposing. Like if you're asked which of 2 restaurants you'd like to go to, and you really want to go to one of them, that doesn't mean you hate the other one. It's just not the one you'd want to go to, given the choice. So while those men would be disappointed if they weren't the proposer, we don't know whether or not that disappointment would be particularly strong or combined with emotions like anger or shame.
I never got a reason. To quote, I was told,		"nah I'm good lol"		Waited through the rest of the week, acted normal, then after my graduation/I was done with school I just didn't talk to her againYou're building her up in your head. That's a real asshole thing to say to someone, much less your boyfriend. You deserve better. If you could get her, you can get someone else.
Haha thanks this actually made me feel better. She's cute and he's... well let's say there's hope for us all if she think he is "super hot".I'm guessing step one for him, then, was "be confident."		Confidence is a large part of hotness! 
I hate myself for laughing at this. Don't! :D

Is Snoopy having a kid canon?Asking the real questions here. I was hoping somebody would already have an answer when I opened these comments, since it's not canon in the comics, but then again, the animated series and comics are mostly independent.
Is Snoopy having a kid canon?One of the puppies in this meme is Snoopy (look at the pup lying on the red doghouse instead of a crib), the dog looking through the window here is one of Snoopy's parents.
Is Snoopy having a kid canon?Is it unwholesome to point out this implies Snoopy had sex at some point?

I spend so much time reading news this year, all of it very much unwholesome, I need some relief at the end of the day. This sub, /r/mademesmile, and anything involving gifs of dogs does a great job.

Its so nice to have one subreddit where everyone on reddit isn't a pissed off college kid. Can't even make a comment anymore without seven ppl saying something along the lines of "hurr durr, actually I know this and you don't even tho I'm wrong as well hurr durr". So annoying. But this place here is a safe happy haven away from all the negativity and it's great. Thanks everyone and thank you mods and thank you person who created this place.Sometimes I worry that the mood'll turn sarcastic or ironic - or worse, obligatory, where you have no choice but to be over-the-top polite at all times, which will really take away those neat, introspective lows that bands everyone together to help an OP work through it.		:) I'm pretty happy that I'm in a sub where I can be invested and concerned in its future.

Honest question,		Is the rise of this subreddit correlated to the polarization of all the political posts on the front page?		Because I feel it has.That probably spurred a lot of people to jump on board with the wholesomeness, but I think the popularity is just a natural reaction to the negative nature of big web communities. Everyone was participating with their elbows out, forcing others to do the same. Now all of a sudden up pops a community that lets you put down your defense and gives you a big ol digital hug? Sign me up.
Honest question,		Is the rise of this subreddit correlated to the polarization of all the political posts on the front page?		Because I feel it has.Honest answer, it started as ironic "happy" memes in direct contrast with me_irl and stuff. Whether the change to honest positivity was for better or for worse is up to you
It is my favourite for sure. I tend to forget the internet doesn't need to be toxic.It's helped to remind me of that too. 		I hope you're having a lovely day ^_^

Is it unwholesome to point out this implies Snoopy had sex at some point?Not if it's with a dog he loves and who cherishes him back!
Is it unwholesome to point out this implies Snoopy had sex at some point?Well, no, not at face-value. If you're pointing it out to take away from the fact that Snoopy looks pretty excited to be a dad, then yes, that probably would be unwholesome. :)
You're awesome! You have a great day too!Have a great night, buddies from europe! :)

One would think /r/wholesomememes, but that's not always the case. Like, earlier today there was a post about a woman that met her husband in a funny way. That post made me very depressed because it reminded me of what I don't have and will probably never have. 		Yet another post in /r/2meirl4meirl was about not killing yourself because of your family. Clearly this is very negative. Yet it made me feel like I'm not alone. And there are many people that are a lot worse than me. 		I don't even remember what was my point in the first place. Just felt like sharing, sorry.		Have a nice day.

As an adult, I need to hear this ~~sometimes~~ most of the time... 		Wonder why this is?

I quit my engineering track because I was failing physics and mostly failing calculus. I thought I could do it on my own because I thought my high school smarts would carry over to college. It didn't but I was too stubborn or embarrassed to get help. Or maybe I was just too lazy to put in that extra effort to succeed in something difficult. 	Years later, my girlfriend is in college and needed help with calculus. A calculus teacher friend of mine volunteered to tutor her and with his help, she went from a C to an A. 	So don't do any of what I did. :) Ask for help if you're trying to do it on your own. Ask the successful people how they're doing it. Resist saying "yeah, but I have to deal with..." Demand help where you need it and don't take any crap if anyone gives you a hard time about it.

"You should sit in nature for 30 minutes every day. Unless you are busy, then you should sit in nature for two hours." Who said that?
"You should sit in nature for 30 minutes every day. Unless you are busy, then you should sit in nature for two hours." It's a vicious cycle. If I am stressed I take some time to relax so I can focus. But then i realise that I haven't done anything in that time so I get even more stressed.
"You should sit in nature for 30 minutes every day. Unless you are busy, then you should sit in nature for two hours." Ya but there's snow dude.
"You should sit in nature for 30 minutes every day. Unless you are busy, then you should sit in nature for two hours." I also heard that walking across the grass in your bare feet helps alleviate stress.

We made this!!I know we're supposed to try to be as wholesome as possible on this sub, but I can't help but be upset that you used the picture with OP's big fat cursor over the Toronto Maple Leafs logo. I helped work on that and I want people to be able to see all the effort we put into it :(
We made this!!I hope the real version is the one with the Chicago Bears logo with the Finnish flag because it made me happy but I understand if people changed it
We made this!!Every time I see this I get angry. Some Brits wrote a script and killed the logo I helped create on Friday night and Saturday morning and spent the whole weekend protecting. Their script along with a ton of alt accounts wiped us off the map and now the piece I worked on isn't represented at all on the final picture everyone keeps posting. 
We made this!!And in the end, the osu! logo is still visible! I'm so glad we managed to survive all the griefers. If only it had ended a couple hours earlier, we would've had a pristine logo, but at least everyone can still tell what it is.
We made this!!No joke this has to be my favorite work of art of all time. I spend so much time on the internet that it's nice to see a piece of art that truly represents it. On top of that, everyone worked together on it, and it's incredible to see how it evolved over time. People might think that this sounds stupid, but I see no reason to take this any less seriously than other works of art (other than things like "Unregistered Hupercum :P).
We made this!!I decided to [uplift his smile](http://imgur.com/AomLQ9S) :)

Why is that a good thing?Pepe used to be good but he's been stolen by certain unsavoury and *most certainly unwholesome* groups. 
I'm glad that the final product did not have any swastikas on itNow that I think about that, no swastikas and no Hitler stuff is really surprising. Good job reddit.
I'm glad that the final product did not have any swastikas on itI'm also glad there wasn't much political stuff. Apart from the Libertarian snake, and Hammer and Sickle, we didn't end up with any political cancer, namely pro- or anti-Trump stuff, infesting the canvas.

Aw it's over?!  Yeah, April 1st social experiment courtesy of reddit. Started Friday afternoon with no warning and no one knew how long it would last. Turned out to be 72 hours.		Was pretty fun.

Proud of it but if the place continued indefinitely we would've 	 had to give up our space eventually, so kinda glad it ended. We're part of the final image and looking sharp up in the top left corner!
> kekistan		not very wholesome at all :(You know, I think the fun of finding out that their slang borrowed from Warcraft/Starcraft (kek) matched an ancient Egyptian frog deity of chaos when they consider themselves chaotic and represent themselves through a sad cartoon frog, and embracing these coincidences as a community, was actually pretty wholesome. I know they then use this as a rallying point for unwholesome activity, but the origin of it all isn't much different from many moments on r/place itself, a group of bored geeks with a passion finding things that just happen to work together and finding unity in that.		Just to be clear, this isn't supporting them or what they do. Just appreciating the non-harmful coincidences of a frog from a comic, video game slang and ancient deities.
> kekistan		not very wholesome at all :(I dunno, I always thought of kekistan as a silly thing and not really anything hateful or derogatory.
> kekistan		not very wholesome at all :(4chan is one of the least wholesome places on the internet. The only time I've seen them being wholesome is when cute animals are posted.

You can see the script come in at the last second and kill us. Ouch, that sucks. You can totally tell something was running that, too.		I was working independently on the Ohio State one for a while and it got taken over. Glad to see it was rebuilt before the end in a different spot
Pepe used to be good but he's been stolen by certain unsavoury and *most certainly unwholesome* groups. I don't think you should let them take over the meaning of Pepe for you. Dogs have been used for propaganda of all sorts of bad causes and we don't hate them or associate them with negative things.
Now that I think about that, no swastikas and no Hitler stuff is really surprising. Good job reddit.No politics, barely any boobs or dicks, no real gore, no hate, yeah I'm genuinely surprised. Well done, Reddit.

I'm also glad there wasn't much political stuff. Apart from the Libertarian snake, and Hammer and Sickle, we didn't end up with any political cancer, namely pro- or anti-Trump stuff, infesting the canvas.I thought the snake was made by r/sneks

They canceled each other out. Maybe, I'm just speculating.

General socialism, different types of anarchism, some libertarian symbols, etc. But no party politics (that I could see) around any country's flag.		The more general the concept the less people are going to argue.
I love that the original happened so quickly.  I think it wasn't even planned or templated or anything, people just recognized "Did you ever hear" and immediately started filling in the rest of it in all different sizes of scribbled pixel-text.		It was amazing.It was originally even misquoted, it said "have you ever heard"
Indeed.Another fine addition to my collection.

There were a few times I had a timer at 20 minutes. That took the fun out of it for me so I stopped :(I got alot of accounts so I was busy all the time.
There was no treaty between them and rainbowroad until the end. They broke the borders, so the rainbow took over and then they made a compact :).I don't think either of those statements are true. 		/r/AmericanFlaginPlace had agreements with rainbow road shortly after the sub started gaining steam. 		The rainbow that filled the flag is suspected of being a false flag attack by void in combination with a hivemind of unaffiliated users simply expanding artwork. Whatever it was, though, the attack was not sanctioned by /r/ainbowroad leadership. 
I wouldn't call either of those hate symbols or derogatoryYea more silly (if a tiny bit crude) than anything. 
I wouldn't call either of those hate symbols or derogatoryI wouldn't either. Just good little chuckles.
Right?! Communism never hurt anyone! are you trying to say capitalism has killed *less* people? 
You know, I think the fun of finding out that their slang borrowed from Warcraft/Starcraft (kek) matched an ancient Egyptian frog deity of chaos when they consider themselves chaotic and represent themselves through a sad cartoon frog, and embracing these coincidences as a community, was actually pretty wholesome. I know they then use this as a rallying point for unwholesome activity, but the origin of it all isn't much different from many moments on r/place itself, a group of bored geeks with a passion finding things that just happen to work together and finding unity in that.		Just to be clear, this isn't supporting them or what they do. Just appreciating the non-harmful coincidences of a frog from a comic, video game slang and ancient deities.Good explanation! Pepe is not a hate symbol!!
4chan is one of the least wholesome places on the internet. The only time I've seen them being wholesome is when cute animals are posted.Nah, 4chan has a much worse rep than they should, mostly because people chose to believe rumors and myths over actually visiting it. Most of 4chan are normal boards that work similarly to reddit, the popular ones are a mixed bag because it was\is a pretty big community. 		They tracked\reported ISIS bases, pedophiles, rapists, lots of animal abuse cases and did random acts of kindness a few times. There are some bad eggs that usually just results in internet harassment, and I guess the majority of what they do is morally neutral and "for the lulz" (altough often involving crude humour). Oh, and like 80% of classic internet memes comes from 4chan.
If you are not with me, then you are my enemy!It is a common belief that only a Sith would deal in absolutes but that in itself would be an absolute, so while I hope you may become a little less black and white after hearing my side of things, I can only ask you to do and say what you're most comfortable with.  
No politics, barely any boobs or dicks, no real gore, no hate, yeah I'm genuinely surprised. Well done, Reddit. Other than the initial dick and obligatory dickbutt, the only boobs I saw were the Mona Lisa's.

No politics, barely any boobs or dicks, no real gore, no hate, yeah I'm genuinely surprised. Well done, Reddit. Actually, the far left has a hammer and scythe, along with some other leftist symbols. I think r/FC and r/FA got together and made that.
4chan were building their weird green Third Reich flag but it was destroyed.It was the flag of their meme country Kekistan, which is a parody of the Third Reich's flag, so it's only kinda related to the Nazis in the fact that it's shaped like their flag and it was fucking annihilated by the rest of the world.
Lol, like Reddit would allow Swastikas and Hitler stuff on their own sponsored Subreddit.Swastikas were thought of as space that no one would mind you conquering.

I thought the snake was made by r/sneks	Really?  I spent three days contributing to it thinking it was a libertarian thing...  I even started the black rectangle around it and the black border around the snek.  Haha.  That's ok.  Was fun.

Probably because the second anything political appeared, the other side immediately jumped on it. They canceled each other out. Maybe, I'm just speculating.I saw an attempt to write r/the_donald above the US flag that got instantly covered in rainbow.
Hey man, regardless of any political side, I thought [comrade party parrot](http://imgur.com/a/YUtm1) was adorableThere was even some adorable artwork of the bird from a Pokmon fan game that happened to have a home in the same section. 		http://i.imgur.com/7TrhvxX.png		Apparently a [sweet gift from one of the game's creators](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFarLeftSide/comments/62uw48/our_little_bird_comrade_would_like_to_thank_you/) after their sprite was embraced by the community.
Another fine addition to my collection.  I like how everyone used to hate the prequels like Anakin hates sand, but now everyone kind of likes them. Ironic.
It's a sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
WE'RE incredibleDONKEY!

It is a common belief that only a Sith would deal in absolutes but that in itself would be an absolute, so while I hope you may become a little less black and white after hearing my side of things, I can only ask you to do and say what you're most comfortable with.  i can't believe this...you turned "only a sith deals in absolutes" into a wholesome meme		if i had money i'd seriously give you all the gold
Other than the initial dick and obligatory dickbutt, the only boobs I saw were the Mona Lisa's. Brazil had a butt above their flag, too.

Actually, the far left has a hammer and scythe, along with some other leftist symbols. I think r/FC and r/FA got together and made that.The cooperation between the far left was pretty wholesome in its own way. I never thought I'd see Ancoms and MLs working together. Brought a tear to the eye
Instead, corporate sponsorshipsSponsorship? I don't think anyone got paid.
It was the flag of their meme country Kekistan, which is a parody of the Third Reich's flag, so it's only kinda related to the Nazis in the fact that it's shaped like their flag and it was fucking annihilated by the rest of the world.Yeah, the joke is that they're called nazis contantly despite not being nazis, so it's a joke at their own expense.

DONKEY!Your pottery looks pretty good.		*You* look pretty good.
When did I mention anything about capitalism? Okay, I'll take that back- why is "communism's track record" or whatever worse than other ideologies that have been used in the past few centuries? 
Brazil had a butt above their flag, too.Well they've earned that. Brazil is famous for nice butts and losing 7-1 at home. That wasn't very wholesome of me. Uhh...Brazil tried their hardest and what really matters is the friends you make along the way?
are her tits still out? i'ma go check.		edit: help i can't find mona lisa		e2: hey, she's fixedMona lisa is just left of the american flag towards the middle. during its creation a very dedicated few were trying to get her tits out, but were overcome in the final effort. You can see it a bit in the timelapse

No but since all the bots did mostly marketable logos, reddit can now use this to charge advertisers saying see how much users like corporate stuff.. or something like that... "your brand has recognition on reddit, dont wanna lose it, or see your brand needs more recognition on reddit".... bots were great for them, but terrible for the spirit of what place could have been.. but reddit is a business... if this was strictly the "social experiment" it was maybe supposed to be, scripts wouldnt have been allowed and whatever genuine pixel placers woud have created would have been it... I don't think your accusations of corporate shilling are very wholesome. People worked hard to put logos in that represent their community, because it was the easiest way for everyone to agree on something that easily represented them. I don't think, for example, the OSU! guys were doing it because they're corporate shills, I think OSU! worked hard to try to make a giant logo because they love their game and wanted it represented in an easily identifiable way. Most of the logos were from games, anyways. There were a couple, like IKEA, but that was clearly a funny Sweden meme. I think having IKEA on the Swedish flag made it funnier than not having IKEA on the Swedish flag, even if you consider that "corporate".

I've seen users post on r/place about making it a weekly thing but who knows?I feel like some things are so special they are not meant to be regular things. This was one of those things that are now part of human history.
Have you seen what happens on the internet when things "run wild"? A bunch of edgy memeing kids make chattbots praise Hitler and renounce Jews in a couple of days.		These people know what happens when you let stuff go unadminisrated. It would have been filled with swastikas, Pepes, Bernie sander and trump symbols and other stuff. I much more prefer this results over that.> Have you seen what happens on the internet when things "run wild"?		Yes /r/Place 		The thing is that /r/place had all th elements to police itself. See a Nazi symbol? Vandalize it. See a 4chan pseudo-fascist project? Turn it into a gay flag.		The racist things couldnt survive because the entire sub would oppose it.

A true millionaireArt that can be bought vs art that is priceless
A true millionaireMy husband and toddler presented me with a homemade birthday card this morning. He wrote it and drew a heart, she colored and did the pretend-writing she started doing yesterday. She (not quite two, with no idea what a birthday is yet) proudly brought it in to show me, and kept saying "heart! Heart!"		It was exactly what I wanted. :') 		[Edit: The card and kiddo in question.](https://imgur.com/a/twELL) Her pretend writing is the dark blue pen on the inside. She calls out random letter sounds as she does it.
A true millionaireHi! I'll leave my stuff here if you feel like checking out more comics!		[Tumblr](http://huffy-penguin.tumblr.com/)		
A true millionairePeople say you can't have it all, you can be rich but at the expense of a loving family. It's popular to draw the Scrooge McDuck CEO who lives in an empty mansion with nobody to love but his money. But I know quite a few wealthy people who make time to spend with their families and are very happy. Anything is possible. 
A true millionaireWho needs money if you have love 	Edit: You certainly need money as well to a certain degree but what's wealth if you cannot share it with your loved ones <3
A true millionaireMy preschooler makes about ten pieces of art per week. And he specifically tells me that he makes each piece to show that he loves me. I keep some on the fridge, tuck some away into a binder, hang some, but.... I don't have space for everything. So I stuff it into the recycling when he isn't looking.
A true millionaireI have the best dad in the world.  		He runs a very very successful company that he is the CEO/founder of.  He has a completely decked out office and drives a Maserati (I have no idea if I spelled that right), but dammit his office is covered with drawings of mine (I'm a designer now), every award I achieved in school, and photos of my brothers and I.  He even has a drawing I made when I was really little and came into his office and made a drawing of a product for his industry for him to "make." He has that pinned up to his wall.  		I love my dad :)
A true millionaireMy financial advisor has finger paintings of his child in $1K frames hanging in his office, it's pretty fucking baller.
A true millionaireSee, this is awesome. This stuff makes me feel good. The comic book artists that are so pessimistic with their work always bring me down. 
A true millionaireWhat an absolutely adorable comic. Stuff like this remind me of how much I can't wait to one day have children. 
A true millionairePow. Right in the feels. My daughter was just born 3 days ago. Look forward to getting her first picture.
A true millionaireDoesn't he have enough room on his walls for 2 paintings?
A true millionaireLovely! See, rich people usually have happy families too. I hate how the media always [portrays](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop) wealthy families as dysfunctional, I guess it's what people want to hear, the idea that if someone has more material wealth than them that they are miserable elsewhere, but it's probably no more likely to be the case. One can be poor, middle class, wealthy and miserable in between or happy in any combination.
A true millionaireThe daughters painting is actually better than the big painting.

Art that can be bought vs art that is pricelessMy cousin and I made a home video once, it was his first time using an iPod touch, and his finger covers half the camera for most of it.		It will be played at his wedding.
Art that can be bought vs art that is pricelessWhen I was helping organize a storage room back when I lived with my parents, I stumbled across a little random box of junk and papers. My dad said something to the effect of "careful, that's my little box of memories." 		It was full of a few dozen doodads and drawings on construction paper from when me, my brother, and my sister were little. Old elementary school doodles and projects. I was honestly pretty surprised, it was cute. 
Art that can be bought vs art that is pricelessI keep coloured card and paper handy for homemade birthday and Christmas cards. It means more and I can personalize it. It also helps when I'm too broke to buy a nice present. Made my first handmade wedding card today and I'm really proud of it. 
Art that can be bought vs art that is pricelessThat comic reminds me of a man I had the pleasure of meeting with many years ago. I was living and working about 30 minutes with a shitty Suzuki rental away in the south of Lisbon Portugal at the time. On some lazy Saturday afternoon my colorful great cousin, also my employer then, told one of his many and often cheesy stories involving his personal friend the unofficial vice King of Portugal. At this point I was already quite annoyed with his all his colorfulness for a while and I decided to call him out. After giving me a smirky look he leaves the room to make a call and about an hour later I am sitting in the shitty Suzuki rental with him driving southeast. We stop at one of the bigger towns on our road to switch the spartan Suzuki with a vintage dark blue BMW 7 Limousine my great cousin proclaims is his. It was just temporarily rented to another friend of his, a professional wedding photographer, because of a temporarily money shortage. We had lots of those. 	We continue heading southeast, now cruising. After 20 more minutes we slow down on a countryside highway and turn to the right following a bumpy road to stop in front of a big rusty iron gate. We wait for some minutes after the Cousin made a quick call for a golf cart arriving on the other side. A suited guy in a vest unlocks the gate for us and as soon as it swings open a bold traditional Portuguese chatterfest is started between the cousin and his friend with the keys. Many minutes later we follow the cart for quite a while when we see a stretched estate and lots of stables after passing more and more horses at the side of the road. We park the car in the shadow between the stables and the long two stories mansion. There are many chimneys and I remember weathered statues and lots of ceramic wall ties with cocks and flowers painted in blue. Also there are horses. I guess horses are ok in general but my immune system doesn't think so. I grind my teeth and leave the limousine breathing with useless caution. While looking around I see an old man with greyish hair wearing a dark red morning coat coming towards us. He is friendly but formal and as the key guy wants to start his introduction process the man just steps right in front of us and another portuguese chatterfest is started without a warning After it has finally ended key guy is happy to deliver the ceremonial part. After that the old man, the brother of the would have been king of Portugal and relative to half of europeans royal families and bloodlines switches to a perfect English and starts to give me a tour through his home. 	I have to come to the end fast now my bath is getting cold. 	So after he had shown me all those big and high rooms filled with used and worn antics and in use fireplaces and a gigantic unused historic kitchen we reach his study at the end of the wing and stroll towards a davenport between two windows. There are about 50 to 60 framed photographs standing on top of it. Pictures of him with his cousin the queen of England, Michael Jackson, Louis Figo and many other then prominent people. It was a pretty impressive gallery but still had a very personal feel to it with all its different frames and many amateur photographs. So there are all these pictures and he chooses to lift up a picture in the middle of the board with a big smile starting to emerge in his face. It turns out he is the godparent of a chimpanzee and a big donor of the lisbon zoo and with the happiest face and the most wholesome voice he shows us his favorite photo with him carrying a young chimpanzee in his arms and won't stop sharing his knowledge and passion for apes and monkeys until we leave. That was one of my most favorite moments of all time, so thanks for reminding me.

But I know quite a few wealthy people who make time to spend with their families and are very happy.

Also in relationships the biggest stressor is money, so having enough of it puts you in a better place overall.

So I stuff it into the recycling when he isn't looking.And that's nothing to feel bad about! The drawings are meant to show you love, not to fill up the house. As long as you feel love when you receive them, they have done their job, no matter what you do with them next!		My daughter draws me at least five rainbows a day. I love them, but of course they go in the recycling!

I have the best dad in the world.  		He runs a very very successful company that he is the CEO/founder of.

That comic reminds me of a man I had the pleasure of meeting with many years ago. I was living and working about 30 minutes with a shitty Suzuki rental away in the south of Lisbon Portugal at the time. On some lazy Saturday afternoon my colorful great cousin, also my employer then, told one of his many and often cheesy stories involving his personal friend the unofficial vice King of Portugal. At this point I was already quite annoyed with his all his colorfulness for a while and I decided to call him out. After giving me a smirky look he leaves the room to make a call and about an hour later I am sitting in the shitty Suzuki rental with him driving southeast. We stop at one of the bigger towns on our road to switch the spartan Suzuki with a vintage dark blue BMW 7 Limousine my great cousin proclaims is his. It was just temporarily rented to another friend of his, a professional wedding photographer, because of a temporarily money shortage. We had lots of those. 	We continue heading southeast, now cruising. After 20 more minutes we slow down on a countryside highway and turn to the right following a bumpy road to stop in front of a big rusty iron gate. We wait for some minutes after the Cousin made a quick call for a golf cart arriving on the other side. A suited guy in a vest unlocks the gate for us and as soon as it swings open a bold traditional Portuguese chatterfest is started between the cousin and his friend with the keys. Many minutes later we follow the cart for quite a while when we see a stretched estate and lots of stables after passing more and more horses at the side of the road. We park the car in the shadow between the stables and the long two stories mansion. There are many chimneys and I remember weathered statues and lots of ceramic wall ties with cocks and flowers painted in blue. Also there are horses. I guess horses are ok in general but my immune system doesn't think so. I grind my teeth and leave the limousine breathing with useless caution. While looking around I see an old man with greyish hair wearing a dark red morning coat coming towards us. He is friendly but formal and as the key guy wants to start his introduction process the man just steps right in front of us and another portuguese chatterfest is started without a warning After it has finally ended key guy is happy to deliver the ceremonial part. After that the old man, the brother of the would have been king of Portugal and relative to half of europeans royal families and bloodlines switches to a perfect English and starts to give me a tour through his home. 	I have to come to the end fast now my bath is getting cold. 	So after he had shown me all those big and high rooms filled with used and worn antics and in use fireplaces and a gigantic unused historic kitchen we reach his study at the end of the wing and stroll towards a davenport between two windows. There are about 50 to 60 framed photographs standing on top of it. Pictures of him with his cousin the queen of England, Michael Jackson, Louis Figo and many other then prominent people. It was a pretty impressive gallery but still had a very personal feel to it with all its different frames and many amateur photographs. So there are all these pictures and he chooses to lift up a picture in the middle of the board with a big smile starting to emerge in his face. It turns out he is the godparent of a chimpanzee and a big donor of the lisbon zoo and with the happiest face and the most wholesome voice he shows us his favorite photo with him carrying a young chimpanzee in his arms and won't stop sharing his knowledge and passion for apes and monkeys until we leave. That was one of my most favorite moments of all time, so thanks for reminding me.K

Wealthy people on average have more opportunities to spend time with families, better health to enjoy that time, better financial standing so taking time off work doesn't hurt as much as some poorer. Also in relationships the biggest stressor is money, so having enough of it puts you in a better place overall.The counterpoint is that the personality often required to get that wealthy often leads to irrational behavior in their personal lives. Of course the executive making a million per year could work half as much and make 300k or something instead, but if he had that mentality, he wouldn't be in this position in the first place.

There was a good comment over on /r/place along the lines that the destruction of art should be not be feared or avoided, but rather it should be acknowledged and respected -- just as how death is what gives life meaning, destruction is what gives art its value.

I'm glad he supported you. A great father. Maybe one day I'll find some sort of adoptive family that actually cares about me.You know what?  His dad left him high and dry while his mom was giving birth to him.  He is a self made man.  He never met the man until the day his father died.  That is the beautiful part about life, some day you get to make your own family (if you want).   Some times the worst fathers produce kids that make the best fathers because they know exactly how not to treat their family. They grow into good parents in spite of theirs. :)

They've been doing a really good autobiographical comic about their transition and their experiences surrounding it since coming out. As dumb as it might sound, she's a little bit of an inspiration and helped me with my own coming out as trans and accepting and being happier with it.
What does that mean?Going to assume it has something to do with Jeremy Kaye now being Julia Kaye. 
Yes, but it is a part of the Hawaiian culture. "Ohana" is changed to Obama here.Thanks Obama! :)
Yes, but it is a part of the Hawaiian culture. "Ohana" is changed to Obama here.And Obama is a Hawaii guy too!
no obama was the president of the united states sillyCharming use of irony!
He's actually getting back into politics--he's gonna work with the Democratic Party to combat gerrymandering.I understand. But he earned a few months off.
He's actually getting back into politics--he's gonna work with the Democratic Party to combat gerrymandering.A) thank you for letting me know this :) 	B) thanks for knowing about gerrymandering 	C) I hope they succeed and soon. I'd imagine having an ex-president working your side is a good boost to popularity and success rates. Gerrymandering actually screws a lot of states and people on a lot of issues. 
If he is then I am super jealous, I would love to have a beer and a meal with Anthony Bourdain. But also if he is, he sure as hell earned it a lot more than I did. Have you seen the episode where they did meet? It was in Hanoi, Vietnam! It definitely had the pretense of politics, but it's still really cool
He didn't even know how to pick up stuff in Wind Waker. It's right on the screen!		But I love him.I miss Kevin

/r/ComedyCemetery sort by topI don't the get why those guys in that subreddit hate him so much. Maybe because he works for BuzzFeed? I don't know about you but it's hard as hell to have to crank out comics almost twice a week just to keep a job. Stand up comedians at least get more time to work on their set than that.
Same here. I guess the buzzfeed hate sticks to the guy since he works there. It's because he's really lazy with his art and will copy/paste entire panels multiple times in the same comic, and his punch lines are often weak and smothered in more weak punch lines.
Charming use of irony!Alanis? 
I understand. But he earned a few months off.In his outgoing interview with NPR, he said something like Michelle deserved a good vacation. I think that's where those pictures of him windsurfing and doing all those other fun things came from.		I'd imagine though that for him, his happiness is tied a lot to his work--you don't run for President if you don't enjoy working hard.

He seems like a workaholic, please don't work yourself to death, Barack...If I may believe Michelle Obama in her interview with James Gordon, he stopped working the moment he was with his family and didn't talk about work unless asked. So I don't think he is a workaholic.		[Link if you want to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln3wAdRAim4)
Dat don't even make sense yo.  He just nipped a Syria/Russia ground war in the bud and had a very successful weekend with the Chinese President and got invited to a big party in China vs Obama not even getting a staircase rolled out to his plane when he landed there, also his excellent SC pick got confirmed despite democrats doing everything in their power to stop it, so we have a full bench again.		Just a couple of many examples, Trump is governing the fuck outta this country right now.Awww. You're trying to justify so hard, aren't you? I'll let you pretend, it's okay. We're in wholesomememes!

I just finished it for my first time today. I can definitely vouch for it.Show?
Unless you want to be a dick. Which isn't really condemnable from this viewpoint.You have to accept that you're choosing to be a dick and any consequences from that are your own fault, though
Unless you want to be a dick. Which isn't really condemnable from this viewpoint.That's actually not true. Not to get too in depth on existentialism the idea is that you can't be a dick, because all human beings worth are equal, so to dehumanize someone is to get rid of someone's worth which is wrong because we are all equal. If anyone wants me to get more in depth I am more than happy to!

Gurren Lagann	       	Good anime, haven't finished it though. I believe it's on Netflix. Guess I'll be on Netflix tonight!
Gurren Lagann. it's got cool robots powered by spirit and manly speechesThank you for the answer!
So if I break their nose, they can't get mad? Sweet.Nah, just don't blame them when they break yours back
But why is it wrong? Can you prove that it's wrong from the ground up using logic with no assumptions?	Ok, so one of the ideas from existentialism is that in a world without meaning it is our job to find our own meanings in life (Sartre), so in that quest for meaning we are all equal. If you dehumanize someone then you are taking away their ability to find their own meaning in life. So all meanings in life are perfectly valid as long as they don't dehumanize people. 
Guess I'll be on Netflix tonight!Have fun!
Nah, just don't blame them when they break yours backCrap. You're right.

Kevin Smith, the kind of guy that is always in costume.Realizing that other people are as well. :3
Obligatory [jorts](http://i.imgur.com/TIFoyeJ.png).		Also great job Kevin on [losing the weight!](http://i.imgur.com/1kL1fC3.jpg)Jorts and a blazer. I wonder if my boss would go for that.
That guy in the background, lol.You and warlizard are in the same thread in the first hour with only like 10 comments. I feel like this is kind of a big deal  
That guy in the background, lol.Omg I would have missed that if not for your comment you great person.

Hooray for Oklahoma residents spreading the love. :)Right? I can't remember the last time I actually read something positive online about the old home state.
Hooray for Oklahoma residents spreading the love. :)I like to think these fine folks are a better representation of us than what has been popping up on the news lately. But "Friendly elderly couple does a friendly thing" just doesn't rake in the ratings.
Kevin is such a cool guy, he's on my top 5 list of celebrities to have a beer with. I think he's more of a joint guy. 
Kevin is an amazing guy. I once saw him do a live SMODcast and afterwards I waited by the rear door with 10 other people and when Kevin came out he spent time with each person then after he had talked to everyone he just started to tell stories for over an hour. Kevin is one of the people I want to meet so badly. He's so nice, full of life and knows how to name a child might I add.

Forgive me, I never say anything, but why is this a wholesome meme? Smith's a very funny dude, but this is a narcissistic tale about how the only thing that redeems old people in Smith's eyes is whether they are familiar with his oeuvre. I don't know. I'm old. Who cares.Haha, I don't have anything against Kevin Smith but I kinda had the same first impression. "Oh look, boring 'white hairs'... oh they're fans, they actually have worth!" :P		To be clear, I totally don't think that's how he meant it, though.
Kevin Smith, I love him!  He is my favorite celebrity.  I love watching Fatman on Batman.  I too was turned onto him by my son (32) compared to my 52 silver haired self. That's a bold statement
Heart warmed, take my upvote damnitDammit - you get one too! :)
He released ~~two~~ four dvds that are just him lecturing to crowds and he has like four podcasts. Dude loves to talk.		Edit: I haven't paid attention to him since 2006, apparently.They aren't just dvds of him talking, he does tours across the world where all he does are answer questions from the audience, I've gone to at least 4 of them so far, they're always hilarious.

I couldn't stop smiling after i read that they got him AGAIN by paying his bill!!  	  	Also, I love the honesty by kevin smith about how wrong he was.  We need more honest introspection like that :)> they got him AGAIN by paying his bill!!		That's the second wonderful thing here - not just that Kevin Smith is a great person (which he is), but that he sees how he is still stereotyping even after spending a good meal with Marty and Patti. We all do it, all the time - it's not something to feel guilty about, but it is something to recognize in yourself.				
especially the creepy guy in the picture backgroundDon't judge a book by its creepy cover!		;P		
	>Thank you Kevin Smith! I'm 68 and husband is 70. 		There are times on reddit I think I should have dementia, am too stupid to still be alive and I couldn't possibly understand the modern world whatsoever.

Damn you sound awesome.  I had to teach my dad (69) how to open a new tab in Chrome the other day.  Although he used to be good with computers and stuff, I'm 100% certain he used to have that knowledge.  I think he is getting dementia :(I caught my mother using a magnifying glass to look at the tiny print on her phone screen. I had to show her how to enlarge the text with her fingers.

My dad is 66 and I had to teach him how to use his new smartphone a year ago. The thing is, he is probably the most intelligent person I know. He recently had to use the programming language R for a research paper he was writing (he's an economics professor). I offered to help him learn, as I am a Comp Sci student and he takes great pains about being known as a dinosaur. He says that he doesn't need my help - he got it figured out in the first few hours. He doesn't fool me with his dinosaur talk any more.

If it's genuinely making you uncomfortable, keep an eye on it.  For my family it's not too bad right now, but we've definitely needed to change routines and expectations to accommodate it.  He gets lost easily, forgets to pay bills, etc.  My mom is definitely in denial about it.

Paging /u/ThatKevinSmith for Nana showing some loveHA! Well that would be cool! :)
My parents are about your age (66 and 68) and my mom still plays video games. And again, not Candy Crush.

Probably because there are people like my mom, who is is coming up on 68, and can't use my smartphone. My dad is in his 50s and stubbornly refuses to learn to use a smartphone. He can use a computer just fine but hell if anyone's gonna make him use a phone.

Footballer keeps his promise to a little girl with deaf parents.The guy is Isco Alarcn, midfielder of Real Madrid, one of the most important soccer clubs in the world.		In that game, which Real Madrid won 3-2 over Gijn, Isco scored 2 of the 3 goals of his team and assisted in the other one. Actually, he scored the third goal of the team in the last minute of the game, which was tied 2-2 until then.		And, although Real Madrid is first in the Spanish league, Barcelona is only 3 points behind (one game difference), so not only did Isco win the game for Real Madrid, he also probably won the league for them, as tying the game would have been disastrous and Barcelona would have gotten to just 1 point (they have to face each other this next Sunday.)		Apart from that, this has been a pretty rough season for Isco, as he's been out of the starting XI for most of the games. However, after this game, he started in the XI against Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinal this last Tuesday and will probably be again in the starting XI in the decisive games of the season.		So, that great gesture came in the best possible moment :)

For sure, people take his "I'm god" persona a bit too serious. He's a great guy.That's how you weed out the people with no sense of humor. The Zlatan would probably be a blast to hang out with. 
For sure, people take his "I'm god" persona a bit too serious. He's a great guy.Wait there are people who don't like zlatan?
PSG came to practice in my city and one of my classmates waited all day to catch the practice and maybe an autograph. He ran past security to see Zlatan, but Ibra didn't have time to take picture. Zlatan then invited him inside the bus in a short ride and let him sit next to him.		It's such a simple gesture from Zlatan, but my friend always lights up when people ask about the experience.That's amazing, and also so Zlatan.  "Oh you ran past security because no one can stop you from going after what you want?  I like you, come hop a ride on the bus with me."
Ronaldo lives an almost unbelievable life on top of it all.  My favorite story about him was when people were trying to get him to auction his shoes and donate the proceeds to pay for a kids hospital bills, but Ronaldo loves his shoes so he just wrote the kid a check instead LOL.  Link to an article here:  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1991295-cristiano-ronaldo-pays-for-10-month-old-babys-operationevery footballer ive known is superstitious about their boots
Even if you don't like him on the field, if you don't admire the absolute magic the dudes ability is, it's something you should. Too many people get caught up in the "x vs x" debate when we're all just so lucky to watch these artists playHe's really inspiring. He's very much like Arnold schwarzenegger. He is pretty much regarded as having the highest work ethic in football or at least in the top 3 or so. That doesn't mean work rate on the pitch before anyone thinks I'm talking about it. I mean his absolute dedication to be as good as he can possibly be. He works incredibly hard on his technique, his athleticism, even only ever eating very specifically designed meals and nothing else. He stays on the training pitch longer than anybody. He wants to be the very best and works incredibly hard to do so. Not that other great players don't also do this, and not that Ronaldo doesn't have natural talent, but he really elevated himself to be one of the best players of all time through his sheer work ethic 	 	Like schwarzenegger he just had a goal to be the best and worked bloody hard to do so. 	 	He should be a player that every aspiring kid looks up to. And every person generally. 	 	Messi is still better mind

They were probably bummed after the first one when he didn't do it. Then pow! He probably thought "oh no, I forgot to do the sign.  I have to score again and do it!"  So blammo, double score!

[And this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eQ2h13twNQ) Zlatan love to talk the talk to the press but in real life, he's just a genuinely nice guy. Him and Pogba are so good with meeting kids.

That is wholesome as fuck! Can't stop smiling.  		Edit: Quite a few of you are saying Zlatan did something wrong by "pushing" the other kid back. We don't have any context here, but I don't see why he would switch them anyway. If that was his dad or something, I'd say the decision was the right thing, but who the fuck knows?Maybe the other kid's idolised zlatan for years, the old man knew that so wanted to make his dream come true. Zlatan shits on his dream :(
Oh my god this video destroyed me in the best way possible.  Something about that kid just makes my heart bleed.  Pogba just seems like such a good dude, really genuine too.If you haven't seen it yet, look up Jermain Defoe and Bradley Lowery.

Not sure if it was ASL or not but I'm 99.99% sure that's how you say I love you in ASL.

I'm certain that just like Christmas and many, many other terms, there are a lot of different ways to say I love you in ASL and other sign languages.
Not sure if it was ASL or not but I'm 99.99% sure that's how you say I love you in ASL. Therefore it could be ASL or other languages use the same sign for I love you as ASL. Yep. It's actually a combinations of the signs for i, l, and y. It's literally "ily". Similarly, "just kidding" is done as "j" then "k".
ASL actually isn't structurally based on the English language- there are plenty of Deaf people who come to the US not knowing a lick of English but who go on to learn ASL I know, but ASL means American Sign Language.		This wasn't in America, so they probably weren't speaking ASL. Like I said though, probably only small differences between their language and ASL.
ASL isn't a transliteration of English into sign - it's an entire language unto itself, with its own grammar and symbolic vocabulary. Signing words by spelling them out alphabetically is the exception, not the rule. ASL is spoken by people all over the world. Small correction: people use sign languages all over the world, but ASL means American Sign Language. Here in Brazil we have LIBRAS for Linguagem Brasileira de Sinais (Brazilian Sign Language), and other countries have theirs. There are similarities between the two, but they're not the same, just like Portuguese and Spanish are similar but not the same.

Is it just me or would it not be logical for two deaf Spanish people to use ASL?>The ILY is a sign from American Sign Language which, as a gesture, has moved into the mainstream. Seen primarily in the United States and other Americanized countries, the sign originated among deaf schoolchildren using American Sign Language to create a sign from a combination of the signs for the letters I, L and Y (I Love You)		According to the [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILY_sign). So I think it's become more of an international sign, they probably use their own language sign language otherwise.

Always be there to help if you can!Remember to never drive tired! Wholesomeness is good and healthy, but know your limit and stay within it.

Remember to never drive tired! Wholesomeness is good and healthy, but know your limit and stay within it.This is very important.

I wish there was more of this in the dating world. Then again, my taste in men has been questionable for quite some time now... Lol I had a lot of relationships like this. I finally realized I haven't been picky enough. 		I no longer give the benefit of the doubt early on, think they'll get better, or stick with a relationship that I'm not really feeling. If I can't talk to them about the stuff that interests me, and if I don't want to listen to them doing the same, then I say, before the third date, that this isn't going anywhere. Since then, I've found people I'm so much more compatible with because I don't waste time on people I don't have the kind of chemistry I desire with. 		Now I just stick with people who are supportive, caring, and willing to make the same sacrifices for me as I am for them. And I've learned, there's a hell of a lot more people out there like that than you'd expect, if you don't waste any time on the people who aren't worth it. Or maybe they're worth it to someone else, but they can't provide what I'm looking for. 
I wish there was more of this in the dating world. Then again, my taste in men has been questionable for quite some time now... Lol *in a James May voice*		....Hello.
I wish there was more of this in the dating world. Then again, my taste in men has been questionable for quite some time now... Lol Wish I could say, "I'm like that." But I objectively know I'm not. That's how I want to be. Instead, most of the time when I talk to people, I do try to listen, but I have this instinct to jump in for every random thought I have. And I have a lot. My brain makes weird connections.		I've met people like this. I wouldn't say it gets better as you get older, as some people learn and some people don't, but it's often worse when you're younger. Most of the people I knew when I was younger didn't even try to listen to other people's views, not really.		Work on who you're friends with and what kind of people you talk to. Make certain to start conversations where people can share views. Look for who welcomes input and who tries to railroad or derail conversations. The ones who welcome input are more likely to listen and reason well and be more likely to have good interpersonal skills. The ones who derail or railroad (like me), might need some work yet. You would be a better judge as to when you should or should not bring up that kind of thing with the person, but if you're just looking for people to get to know, that may be less of an issue. Good luck on it moving forward.
Can confirm. I've done this.	One of my friends has these moments of genius and I've spent hours up in the middle of the night with him on his rants and flows of genius.That's awesome! I hope everything your friend comes up with is fruitful!

This is weird. Been browsing this subreddit for some long hours and I'm already slightly creeped out by this unnatural cult-like niceness.		If it's working out for you guys, good for you. But this place feels fake to me. Sorry.I see how you could think that. For what it's worth, although people are outrageously nice here, I don't feel that it's fake niceness. I think some people have a lot of kindness in them that they often have to suppress in the real world for fear of getting taken advantage of or seeming overly familiar, manipulative, weird, or just fake like you say. So I think a lot of us here are just enjoying the opportunity to be genuinely kind and uplifting to each other.  		For me at least, it's really refreshing and relieving to have a space where treating each other with all this compassion is welcome and accepted, kind of like a haven on an internet where strangers being cruel to each other just for the hell of it is pretty much expected.

When r/iamverysmart meets r/wholesomememesWords like "vision," "idea," and "insight" do not an /r/iamverysmart post make. The meme is just a fun way to express that the partner values their companion's thoughts and opinions and is willing to sacrifice their own time to help them explore those ideas, which is a dynamic we can all stand behind :).
Also always obey all traffic laws. Driving recklessly endangers more people than just yourself!So, are you saying to not drive fast and furious?
Also always obey all traffic laws. Driving recklessly endangers more people than just yourself!Also, try to avoid getting angry at bad drivers. It's not worth it to raise your blood pressure and stress over something that doesn't matter. 
That's sleepy tired instead of exhausted from working tiredIt's both. If you're sleepy, you may lose consciousness or at least have a worse reaction time or notice less while driving. All of these can be dangerous, especially falling asleep while driving. So it is very important to never drive while sleepy.		However, being physically tired such as from exercise, manual labor, or a number of other possible origins may lead one to lose focus or be unable to react appropriately while on the road and should also be avoided unless necessary.		Some people do know their limits, and I'm not saying you have to be fully rested and relaxed to drive. But please use proper judgement in both of these and other situations. Remember that cars carry a large momentum and should be respected as the dangerous but useful tool that they are. When needed, call a friend, a taxi, an Uber, or save a little gas and support your local public transportation system. But whatever you do, be safe out there and have a great day!

You want my insight on that? *jumps in car*Hey man, can we carpool? Nothing like thinking about the environment first!
Up to and including the occasional rim job.Beyond that, even. If two consenting adults are openly interested in sharing some kind of kink between the two of them, we have no place to judge them for what makes them feel good as long as the acts don't cause any lasting damage to one's body or mind.
maybe they're just close friends?Actually it sounds like she's trying to pitch him a 'business opportunity' in a pyramid scheme
Yeah, it started happening a few weeks ago and then it died out again. Was hoping we were past it.Any posts in particular that come to mind? I enjoy this classic wholesomememe, but can appreciate how it might come across weirdly. I like to think all posts here are wholesome, but some do make me go hmm.
I know this isn't necessarily wholesome, but your friend might have undiagnosed bi-polar disorder.  Just something to consider.As someone who actually has bipolar, this is not nearly enough to even come close to suggesting it is bipolar. DSM-V criteria, while not perfect, does say you need to first check if the behavior could be attributed to anything, and there's 1000 other reasons someone might due this that have nothing to due with bipolar. 		People attribute shit to bipolar that they shouldn't all the time. It's one of the most misunderstood disorders and the way people trivialize it over little things like this makes people take it less seriously when I say I have it. 		Sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick or take away from the wholesomeness, but this is a very, very serious disorder. People die from it. People destroy their lives because of it. And it's both frustrating and hurtful to have the disorder I have tried to kill myself over taken down to the level of "I rant at my friends at midnight." 
So, are you saying to not drive fast and furious?Drive safely and calmly.

Definitely a good boy"Okay, hoomans, push! Puuuush!"
Definitely a good boySo not too long after I adopted this pitbull (mix?) we had days of heavy winter rain and I was dismayed to find water coming in under the wall in the garage/bottom floor.  Dismayed because now I have to soldier-crawl around in the muck in the crawl space and hand-dig dirt that had built up around the foundation so this water will drain.  And btw, it's around 40F (cold for here!) and I didn't have any kind of gear for that kind of shit.		It was when she started crawling around behind me, digging just as I was that I saw that yes, she really was a good girl.  It was cute as hell.

Dogs understandMy dog does this every damn time and it's ridiculously cute how determined she is to make friends with every human she passes but I always get anxious that I'll pass someone who's scared of dogs and slightly inconvenience them for a few seconds. But I can't explain that to my doggo. She thinks I'm just preventing her from making friends :(
Dogs understandHe loves me for who I am :) Dogs are the best, friends!
Dogs understandThe other day on my daily walk with my coworkers we encountered a very adorable dog. We asked if we could pet it and the owner said sure and the dog immediately flopped over so we could all pet his belly and his little tail was wagging so hard and I swear he had a little doggo smile on his face and we just all went back to work in the best mood! 
Dogs understandDogs are the shit.
Dogs understandThat always brightens my day too.		Dogs are all the best parts of humans because we've bred them for the traits we wished we had.
Dogs understandThis was me the other day. I was walking past this adorable (slightly chubby) lab, and all I was thinking was how much I wanted to pet him. Well I guess he wanted me to pet him just as much, because he lurched for me as I walked past. I took it as a sign, asked for permission, and then pet the doggo. :)
Dogs understandMy shiba is a total ladies man - he always wants pets from girls but didn't care too much when a guy walked by.
Dogs understandMine is when I come home and my roommate's dog sees me,  she gets this big silly grin and runs at me full speed like I am the most amazing person on Earth and she can't stand to not be near me for one more second. It makes me feel awesome :) 
Dogs understandMy doggy friend came to visit me today, and I had forgotten to unlock the front door so there was a delay in greeting him upon arrival. I could hear him eagerly whining and scratching at the door until I got it open I haven't felt so wanted all month.
Dogs understandThere's a big ole' 9-month Great Dane at the office next to mine. I saw him as a puppy at 5mos, he's now this giant gangly goof. 		The problem with Danes is that they're just too damn sweet, a little dog in a big dog's body. He sees someone he doesn't know, he barks because he wants to find out more and be your friend. Problem is, magilla over here doesn't figure out that he's got a big dog's bark, so everyone just wonders what the hell is going on.
Dogs understandThat's like a dog saying "Bro, do you want to be friends?"		And I'm like "You bet your ass I want to be friends."
Dogs understandMe too! I almost feel ashamed like I don't wanna anger their owner for takin attention away from them, buttt Awww hey! how are you! ok I love you too byeeee! I may or may not being able to understand dog I'm not sure yet I'll get back to you <3

My dog does this every damn time and it's ridiculously cute how determined she is to make friends with every human she passes but I always get anxious that I'll pass someone who's scared of dogs and slightly inconvenience them for a few seconds. But I can't explain that to my doggo. She thinks I'm just preventing her from making friends :(I was scared of big dogs for a long time after being bitten as a child - the ones on leashes with an attentive owner not the ones that scared me. Especially if they had that goofy grin and a blurry tail. Even as a kid I understood "happy dog". It was the loose ones or the ones that would run up to fences snarling.

But I can't explain that to my doggo. She thinks I'm just preventing her from making friends :(I used to walk dogs in an animal shelter, and there was one that was super hyperactive in her kennel. I usually let other people walk those dogs because it's really difficult to get the harness on and to control them outside, but I was specifically requested to do so one time. Turns out, she was really nice outside, and instead of running around uncontrollably, all she wanted was to go up and say Hi and get pets from EVERYONE. Love that dog.  		Edit: [pic](https://imgur.com/Rn0qexO) of the doggo during my first walk with her. 
He loves me for who I am :) Dogs are the best, friends!> Dogs are the best, friends!		And dogs are the best friends!
The other day on my daily walk with my coworkers we encountered a very adorable dog. We asked if we could pet it and the owner said sure and the dog immediately flopped over so we could all pet his belly and his little tail was wagging so hard and I swear he had a little doggo smile on his face and we just all went back to work in the best mood! As someone who has a cute dog that everyone stops ([not bragging; really adorable with floppy ears](http://imgur.com/a/WBu54)) I love when this happens.

My shiba is a total ladies man - he always wants pets from girls but didn't care too much when a guy walked by.Best wingman ever.
It's ok.

I don't think there's any other creature on Earth that could have done that to me and still have me so trusting and full of love for them
I have sorta the opposite reaction. I want to pet the dogs that come up to me, but I'm afraid the owner wouldn't like it.Ask! People are usually okay with it!

My dog does the opposite; she doesn't care about people who don't have food.  I always feel bad for people who go to pet her and get snubbed; I want to explain each time that it isn't them   I've found it funny when people try to approach my service dog without permission.  She won't even climb into my lap when she has her cape on, and will full on turn her head away from people if they try to pet her when she's working.  They always look so offended, but I don't feel bad at all.  		Two seconds later after I take her cape off, she's all up in their business wanting pets.

I am seriously trying so hard not to cry :((( whoever took the photo is a scummy, SMALL BULLY! Fuck bullies. Fuck every last one of them.
Dancing manMad props to Cassandra! Seems like a sweet girl.		We need more genuinely caring people in this world
Dancing manIt's so awesome that we can use the power of the internet to connect with, and make others lives better! 
Dancing manI've seen the story when it happened, a few years ago, but it was just the first pictures. And it just made me mad, how and why were people so mean - and worst of all, proud of it and boasting of their cruelty!		I never knew he was found. I mean, I hoped so, and as there was a huge commotion and a lot of people tried to spread the "invitation" I believed he was eventually found. But I have never had any confirmation of that. Until now.		Seeing those last pictures made me so happy. This story that I didn't even remember suddenly came back to me and with closure. I wonder how he is now. 		Godspeed, dancing man. Godspeed.
Dancing manOK, so you just made my eyes leak.  I have never danced in public because of my assumption of all being those who laugh and make fun of people like dancing man and me.  Very nice to know there are those out there who support the spirit within. :_)
Dancing manPretty sure most of the 4channers were just as appalled as everyone else if I remember the thread correctly.
Dancing manFirst time I saw the first two pictures I cried so hard.  His body language in the second picture stills makes me cry.  As a man who was 5 ft 61/2 inches (when you're 5 61/2 you count the half) and 308 lbs I can relate with him and never felt good looking enough to dance.  I would go to the clubs with friends and they would dance with women and I would just stand against the wall or stay bellied up to the bar.  The ending of his story was so beautiful and reminded me how amazing people can be.  Started watching my portions and my intake, I'm down 53 lbs from then, but still 5 61/2. 
Dancing manDefinitely my favourite wholesome post on the internet. Rock on dancing man!

Dancing man4chan getting rekt? What a nice day
Dancing manNever stop dancing, big man. 
Dancing manSo amazing, I would love to dance with him.
Dancing manI love when the internet comes together to do good deeds 
Dancing manThat was awesome. Reminds me of one of my favorite song lyrics, from Macklemore's "And We Danced:"			"I am not, I am not going to stand on the wall		I will dance, I will dance, I will break that ass off		And I see you in the corner, corner looking so small		Doing the robot like, if I die tonight, *at least I went hard*		I will not, I will not give a damn who watches me		I will live, I will live, liberate the fox in me"
Dancing manFuck. That dejected look in the first picture hurts so bad.
Dancing manHEY I WAS THERE! 		This dude is a legend! 		This also reminds me about last week. I'm staff at a gym. I'm a fitness freak and I love seeing people improve and have that drive to better themselves. I *live* for it. 		There was a guy in there that was a heavier set dude, and he was working his ass off with the sled. Shit, I'm well built but this dude pulled more weight than me and he was sweating uranium. Serious dedication and he's been with us a while now, making great progress. His dedication puts us all to shame. 		Then this "bro" walks up, annoyed that he has to wait for the sled. Alright, whatever, you're frustrated because maybe you're having a bad day or something. I tell him to just relax and do something else while the other man finishes with his set. I'm not sure if he noticed that I was staff at this point. (For reference, I'm a 5'2 woman, so I might not seem too authoritative... But give me a reason to I will be, as a Navy veteran and current instructor) 		Bro doesn't accept this and after 25 seconds he tells the bigger fella that "come on fatso, I haven't got all day" and that he "should waddle his fat out of there". I lost my shit. Told the now rather upset man who had lost all his motivation to keep doing his thing, and that I was fucking proud of him. Gave bro a lecture on how the other guy is an example to all of us, and that I'm far more proud of him for working his ass off there than for an already muscle mountain douchebro hanging out there for the third time today. 		I think he got my point, and apologized. I still told him to leave. People like that can find somewhere else to workout than my gym. In my gym, everyone is welcome as long as they encourage each other and don't look down on people. We all deserve a chance at being the best us we can be, and we should all strive to help those around us with that. So fuck that shitty behavior. 		Jonathan, the heavier dude, came by before he left as I was about to leave on a PT run and gave me a hug. He said that he was so touched that someone would stand up for him like that. I gave him three months free extra on his membership as compensation for douchebro. He's an example to us all, and so is dancing man. 
Dancing manI'm glad they found him! But I feel so bad that he ever got laughed at. I am on the verge of tears, here.
Dancing manOn the wholesome note. I was so drunk, sorry didn't see the rest. I'm glad this guy had fun also I love this sub 
Dancing manI really hope a certain Men Without Hats song got played that night. 
Dancing manThat is absolutely amazing.
Dancing manSorry guys I'm drunk. Didn't see the rest 
Dancing manNot to spoil the party but didn't it turn out the pics were taken out of context and he milked it for a while? I feel like I remember being disappointed in the end

OK, so you just made my eyes leak.  I have never danced in public because of my assumption of all being those who laugh and make fun of people like dancing man and me.  Very nice to know there are those out there who support the spirit within. :_)I would dance with you. 		I was taking a road trip once, stopped in a small town 1000 miles from home. Walked down to the water where I heard some music playing, feeling a little lonely and isolated. No one was dancing, but a great band was playing near a group of kids who were struggling with some severe disabilities.  One kid must have sensed it, and although he couldn't speak to ask he bolted out across the crowd and tried to take my hand and gestured for me to come  dance with him.		I didn't want to say no to dancing with him, but I'm shy and was petrified. Everyone knew everyone in this town, so every single head turned to stare at the stranger and see how I would respond. So I sucked it up. Went out onto the grass and danced my brains out with a kid who could hardly walk or hold onto my hand. God bless the south, and hospitality, because the whole damn town came out to join us on the dance floor. I had more food, drinks, and new friends than I ever could have wanted. Sometimes you just have to dance. Everyone else will follow :)

Very nice to know there are those out there who support the spirit within. :_)Honestly, the kinds of people you want to be dancing with are not the kinds of people that laugh at other's dancing. I think you should give dancing a try. I'll dance with you.

I just love watching people of all types moving in whatever way feels enjoyable to them. It's so refreshing, and I encourage you not to be too afraid to do it yourself.

Good dancing or bad dancing, never show the slightest bit of shame and you'd be surprised how many people will join you. I'm a notoriously bad dancer but when I get out there, I dance so hard there's no room for mockery, only jealously. 
Pretty sure most of the 4channers were just as appalled as everyone else if I remember the thread correctly.This is surprising, but I'm willing to believe it.
First time I saw the first two pictures I cried so hard.  His body language in the second picture stills makes me cry.  As a man who was 5 ft 61/2 inches (when you're 5 61/2 you count the half) and 308 lbs I can relate with him and never felt good looking enough to dance.  I would go to the clubs with friends and they would dance with women and I would just stand against the wall or stay bellied up to the bar.  The ending of his story was so beautiful and reminded me how amazing people can be.  Started watching my portions and my intake, I'm down 53 lbs from then, but still 5 61/2.  Keep at it brother!
4chan getting rekt? What a nice day[OP got rekt on 4chan too](http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/images/dancing_man_4chan.gif)
4chan getting rekt? What a nice dayThe entire thread on 4chan was taking the piss out of OP.
I'm not going to read any of the comments because I want this to be the real thing so bad. I haven't seen this posted before and in this current_year full of memes, in the moment I read this, I need this to be real on a personal level.Don't worry, it was real. They had a party and it was a good time.
Is it weird if I find big people like him adorable?		EDIT: Why am I getting downvoted? Is it because of how I clarified what kind of cute I mean? I'm a straight man, that's why I'm not attracted to him, not because I find him ugly, which I don't. My question was genuine.		EDIT2: I just realized that instead of "cute", using 'adorable" probably would've made more sense, and so I'm revising the comment.Stop playing with my emotions.
They are making fun of him how is this wholesome? Don't worry, carry on reading. 
They are making fun of him how is this wholesome? there are more images bud ;)
They are making fun of him how is this wholesome? Did you stop at the first picture?
They are making fun of him how is this wholesome? There are multiple images; the first one is awful, but all the other ones are amazing!
Fat pandering. If people were laughing at me I would stop dancing too and I'm perfectly average. Can I haz dance party?They wouldn't have made the post if you weren't fat. 
Why did they give him a fat lady?They didn't 'give' him a fat lady.		Large bodies gravitate towards each other.

I love that people really came together for a good cause, it definitely shows that there are so many good, kindhearted people out there!I've seen the original picture and a lot of people defending the happy dancing man, but I didn't know about any of this.

Andrew WK wasn't invited, notified, or even in the same continent as the party that day.  But when the party started, he was there.  Because that's just how Andrew WK is.

Stumbled into their show this October in Minneapolis. Never heard of him before but it was pretty great. We even started the encore chants because Minnesota people don't know how to get a couple extra songs out of the artists. They're probably tired after the performance, better let them rest.

And we didn't focus on the bad guys.Who? 
It kills me to think that people wanted to ruin his night and then BRAG about it. Normally nothing good ever comes of such a horribly toxic act, but this time something did... A ballin party that was thrown for dancing man! I hope that wholesome acts keep spreading to the point where prople would step in while horrible things like that first post are in progress. It's depressing how common this kind of thing seems to be.  I'm around that guy's size, if not bigger, and I run into shit like this a lot.  Just a few months ago, I was hiking up part of the John Muir Trail and was checking out the 7 Lakes with my mom, my wife, and my kids.  We stopped by one of the lakes for a lunch break and we let our son play in the water for a bit.  He wanted me to join him and I was getting ready to, but as removing some of my gear, this group of kids (18-22 range by the looks of them) started making fun of me.  It totally ruined what should've been a fun adventurous day.  I should've been proud of myself for how hard I worked to hike there, but at that point, I wanted to give up.  The whole way back to the trail head, I was a complete asshole to everyone and I didn't really get over it until sometime after dinner that night.  I mean, it still bothered me, but it wasn't consuming my thoughts.		I hate that something like this can affect me so much.  I've been putting up with people like this my entire life and yet they still manage to get to me sometimes.  It's disheartening to know that strangers out there hate me almost as much as I do.
If I remember correctly, even people on 4chan were upset about it. Yeah I remember that thread, general opinion was that OP was a dick

I would dance with you. 		I was taking a road trip once, stopped in a small town 1000 miles from home. Walked down to the water where I heard some music playing, feeling a little lonely and isolated. No one was dancing, but a great band was playing near a group of kids who were struggling with some severe disabilities.  One kid must have sensed it, and although he couldn't speak to ask he bolted out across the crowd and tried to take my hand and gestured for me to come  dance with him.		I didn't want to say no to dancing with him, but I'm shy and was petrified. Everyone knew everyone in this town, so every single head turned to stare at the stranger and see how I would respond. So I sucked it up. Went out onto the grass and danced my brains out with a kid who could hardly walk or hold onto my hand. God bless the south, and hospitality, because the whole damn town came out to join us on the dance floor. I had more food, drinks, and new friends than I ever could have wanted.

I lost a shoe (but luckily found someone else's lost shoe that fit, hope they found mine!) and injured a rib to the point that I couldn't breath right for a month or two.  The crowd rushed the stage and I got up there with him.  I've been to countless shows, AWK shows are the best shows.

For no reason, and at the request of no one he walks back out on stage and just starts dancing even though no music is playing and there's like 4 people in the venue besides the staff.

You know you messed up when /b/ unanimously agrees that you're a dick.They get on board with being a dick sometimes. All it would've taken was for the first reply to be in support of shitting on this sad fat person, who obviously has self control problems and was making everyone else uncomfortable with his BO and creepy glances. 		Instead, the first reply humanized him. "He's just some dude who wanted to have a good time. Paid for a ticket and came to see a group we all love. Why you gotta harsh his vibe?" 		That's all it took to sway the masses. One person choosing to tell someone they're being a dick.
WK doesn't get tired.  I saw him play one of the most insane shows I've ever seen, running around, dancing, and partying for an hour and a half.  After TWO encores he was forced to stop the music, people start filing out and after the stage was broken down and the gear taken away.  For no reason, and at the request of no one he walks back out on stage and just starts dancing even though no music is playing and there's like 4 people in the venue besides the staff.  A true mad man and party god.  Got to meet him once and he was so kind and humble.  One of my favorite people.Didn't he break a record for drumming for 24+ hours straight? He's a man fueled only by parties and happiness.

As a younger man I often found myself participating in that sort of shaming, and eventually even thinking that way to myself. 		It was articles and posts like these that taught me I was being the kind of person I hate. A bigoted, small minded, hateful person. 		And I'm sorry to everyone I ever hurt every single day. Every single time I see someone struggling with their health or just going about their life I remind myself that everyone is different, and regardless of personal choices everyone deserves respect. 		I want to say thank you. Just for being you. You've taught me not to be hateful, just like everyone else I meet does these days. Thank you so much. These are the loveliest conversations I've ever seen on Reddit.  The Dancing man post and the comments its spawned legit made me tear up like a big pansy.  I love it.

It's almost as if people are complex individuals that possess merits as well as flawsyou say that sarcastically, but this is honestly very hard for us to accept as humans. we see others as a whole, rather than a bit of this and a bit of that. it's easier when the person is close to us, but so hard to accept those nuances with people we don't really know. I think this broad categorization effect was an evolutionary advantage that doesn't translate very well to the modern day
Hasn't 4chan been "dead" for a while? It's really old now so I figured it would be changed a lot or left by most people.I've literally been hearing this shit for over 10 years now
Hasn't 4chan been "dead" for a while? It's really old now so I figured it would be changed a lot or left by most people.Nah it's in the alexa 500 IIRC		Although the most active boards seem to be /b/ and /pol/ (but a lot of that activity is shilling).

Danny Sexbang is my hero! NSP rocks!! I know who he is, but telling random people your hero is a man who make entertainment videos on the Internet called 'danny sexbang'. May turn a few heads
Unexpected NSP. I had a terrible PTSD nightmare last night, woke up thinking I was having a heart attack, started sobbing uncontrollably, and immediately put on Dan's cover of "The Last Unicorn" on a loop for 45 minutes. It was the only thing I wanted to calm me. I love his voice, it's like buttah. I can safely say Game Grumps and NSP has distracted me long enough not to harm myself, many times. They mean so much to me. To be honest I found them in a time when I needed them most as well. I've heard their joke stuff but the first time I heard their version of "Last Unicorn" I knew they could be a real, serious band. That song in particular will always have a spot in my heart. Stay strong, you have brothers and sisters here for you.

If the first one was the only one then there would have been a chance for it to turn into a laugh fest, since he's kinda goofy in that one. But in the second photo he just looks so sad and defeated... That's too much for most people to swallow. OP was the heartless minority.		And besides, most people have probably felt embarrassment of some kind when trying to dance. Not everyone is born a natural. So to see a person get photographed and laughed at publicly for trying to dance feels like a nightmare scenario...

I've literally been hearing this shit for over 10 years nowlol was about to say the same. "4chan is dead" is the real dead meme.
Do you think I care about him?  I'm just stating a fact. 		The meme isn't wholesome because he's dying under his own body.	How about the fact that dancing is fucking exercise and that's what he was there to do? Stop being a judgmental prick. You say he can't be happy in his body but personally, I'd be much happier being fat than living my life as a hateful little shit.

Here is our latest effort - http://imgur.com/a/MLX4pI've painted with Bob Ross with MS Paint!  It's a fun challenge and will look great if you follow how he does it.  I'll post a piece later.		[It's definitely not exceptional, but it turned out better than I expected!](https://i.imgur.com/eT4CNow.png)
You *can* paint though! It's super easy and super fun. It takes some time and patience, but you just gotta follow the Ross' steps and you'll be there in no time. Heck, soon you'll be making up your own mountains and nice little trees without anyone to guide you but yourself!What wonderful job you've done taking over the Keywork! 
Agree and did the same. It's like a leap into another universe for a little while, where it's ok not to be ok. Thank you for the post! A lot of my family paints for fun. Always a little self-conscious there. But maybe I'll take it up again and everything will just be a happy accident.
You *can* paint, though. Maybe not as good as you'd like, but that's more of a problem with what you'd like, rather than your ability to paint. Sucking at something is the first step at being sorta good at something.It is great just to create!		Unless one's job description is artist, don't be too hard on one's self. Enjoy the process and journey!

How lovely (: the same to you crimsonmeteor, you too are a wonderful human being!Thanks! Hope you, too, have a nice day ;)
This is just a string of words that you put on the internet in a few seconds, but my girlfriend just dumped me and I really needed to hear that. Thank you <3Hey friend, sorry to hear that. I've been there, done that. Breakups are no fun. Try to have a day for yourself. Hang out with some friends, go do something you enjoy, anything to stay positive. Keep your head up, it gets easier. 
jesus christ this feels so fake"Hey look at all of these positive people, let me come in here and be a dick."		I feel sorry for you. I feel sorry that you deem it necessary to shit on someone's positivity, that you feel the need to diminish a wholesome comment solely intended to make someone's day better. I feel sorry that you are so self-loathing that you have decided to go down the path of denouncing others happiness. 		I hope you one day decide to be a better human being, because the path you just took is a dead end to loneliness. 
jesus christ this feels so fakeFake it till you make it. 
jesus christ this feels so fakeDepending on what you want to believe.	This world can be a harsh place full of people lying and backstabbing each other for their own gains. Or it could be better than that. Only how you want to see it.	This doesn't mean that you're blinded to the truth just don't think about it.	Just because you can find videos of people chopping others heads off or burning them alive doesn't mean you need to see it. There're many good things that can be found on the internet like cat videos for an example.

Youtube comments aren't as bad as they used to be to be honest. The top comment on most videos is like a top reddit comment. Example from video I watched today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_iKg7nutNYJust don't look at trending. Seriously.

Those comments and other random dumb things still flood all the videos I see, but a (comparatively) clever comment does come through now and then.
I met my wife in the YouTube comment section:) On certain channels, it can be a beautiful placeThat's crazy! So tell me the details, how did you two met?

[Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNEp3hoHSDI). I tried to find that exact spot but wasn't able to find it. Enjoy!Listen to the intro Bob says. His son Steve is an accomplished painter and sold his first painting at age 12.		One of the top reposts in TIL is that Bob was some drill sergeant and went to painting to chill the fuck out because he was tired of yelling.		The fact that one of the most iconic painters in our lifetimes quite possibly learned from his son kinda blows my mind a bit.

I have no idea why, but my heart melted when he said "thanks Dad" at the beginning.He thanks him again at the end of the painting.
Where is Steve Ross today?  He could have the biggest YouTube channel in history just by being swell. [A thread from a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3rtpvu/what_happened_to_steve_from_bob_ross_the_joy_of/)
Where is Steve Ross today?  He could have the biggest YouTube channel in history just by being swell. I googled it and found [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3rtpvu/what_happened_to_steve_from_bob_ross_the_joy_of/?st=J24UJAI5&sh=99e7dcbd) No guarantees on the accuracy of the information though. 
Very impressive... What all do you need to get started? Did you buy a kit or individual supplies?To start up, you'll need a few basic things. [The Bob Ross Master Piece Set](https://www.amazon.com/Martin-F-Weber-Master-Paint/dp/B000IK0EIA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493566815&sr=8-1&keywords=bob+ross+kit) has the majority of what you need (paint, knife, brushes), then you'll want a [big plexiglass palette](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Advantage-18-Inch-24-Inch-Acrylic/dp/B0027AE8UE/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1493566898&sr=8-8&keywords=paint+palette+clear) for mixing the paints. Finally, you'll need an easel to hold a canvas. I can personally recommend [this one](http://www.dickblick.com/products/blick-studio-convertible-studio-easel/) from Blick if you have one near you. Hope that helps, if you get into it, be sure to sub to r/HappyTrees to share your work!
Very impressive... What all do you need to get started? Did you buy a kit or individual supplies?In addition to what the other guy said, if you're on a budget you can skip the plexiglass pallet and use something else (I've got a plastic plate that was like four for a dollar at Walmart), and instead of a standalone easel you can get a tabletop one (mine was just a bit fancier than this one and cost me about $15 http://www.michaels.com/black-display-tabletop-easel-by-artists-loft/10504506.html#start=7)
Looks like a scene from Zelda breath of the wild. Nice work!  Did you guys start by following Bob in real time or did you pause how videos a lot?We definitely pause **a lot.** A typical Bob Ross episode is ~25 minutes, but, on averge, each painting takes us around 4-5 hours. Granted this is with some goofing off and drinking a few beers, but we always enjoy our time!
Yooooo those are incredible! I literally went "woooahhhh" when I clicked the link. You guys should hang those up in your houses, they'd be great decorations with great story behind them! "Oh that one? Yeah I did that one with a couple friends"Thanks for the kind words. This was our 4th painting. This was [number 3.](http://imgur.com/a/0p2di) 
I think I sense a novelty account coming on.The best kind of novelty account! People could use a bit more positivity and friendliness these days, especially on the internet! :)
Yeah, its "easy"if you paint like shitThat'll happen, BUT! If you keep honing your craft, you'll see improvement.
Yeah, its "easy"if you paint like shitNot very wholesome, friendo. 
Thank you for the post! A lot of my family paints for fun. Always a little self-conscious there. But maybe I'll take it up again and everything will just be a happy accident.You totally should! Art is one of the greatest things humans can do! As a skill, it only gets better with practice, so you can see your own progress which will only get better, encouraging you to do more. It's a perfect circle. And if you feel like you don't have a good style, don't think that! Everybody's style is unique to them in some way, some people like Pollack while others think it's just splatters. I believe in you and hope you post r/idrewapicture or r/art someday when you are comfortable.
Show name?	I don't believe Netflix has his show the Joy of Painting but I think it has the other one called Beauty is Everywhere. The Joy of Painting has episodes up on YouTube. :)

Yeah /u/ichdruecknix, what can we do for you?Hey, thanks for answering.. I was crying a lot and didn't know what to so I wrote here.. my best friend with whom I'm in love with for 6 years just broke contact with me because she said my love was destroying her life.. it's especially hard for me right now because I'm suffering from depression and am in psychiatry, but nothing seems to help me.. thanks for not leaving me alone..
God I love this subWe love you too
God I love this subWe love you more :)
God I love this subRight back atcha buddy!
Your positivity is wonderful!Thank you! I'm sure you're a downright swell person!
Just don't look at trending. Seriously. Ah, just like a lot of default subs
That's crazy! So tell me the details, how did you two met?We were long distance for a very long time, just using Kik and Skype, since we were from different countries. Eventually we met, fortunately New Zealanders have a very easy time getting a visa to England. It was very awkward at first, but it was kinda like meeting up with a friend you havn't seen in years- eventually you get into the rhythm, and things are great. 		I guess I'll always be thankful to the youtuber Emma Blackery, though I don't watch her anymore
That's crazy! So tell me the details, how did you two met?Yes! Details, please! This sounds like a very interesting story.
Now you made me tear up! Go Ross family! Aaaaaah I'm not crying it's tears of joy!!!
Thanks for the kind words. This was our 4th painting. This was [number 3.](http://imgur.com/a/0p2di) I don't know why but the idea of a group of friends hanging out watching Bob Ross and painting seems really dope. Those paintings look great, hard to believe that's only painting #3. Do you have #1 and #2?
The best kind of novelty account! People could use a bit more positivity and friendliness these days, especially on the internet! :)You're absolutely right, ToothpickinCockhole! 
I don't believe Netflix has his show the Joy of Painting but I think it has the other one called Beauty is Everywhere. The Joy of Painting has episodes up on YouTube. :)Australian Netflix has Joy of Painting, don't know about others though!
You don't get to choose truth. Not seeing those things doesn't make them go away, and you suggesting it's okay to ignore them shows you're both privileged and unsympathetic to the suffering of others. You practically just said "Plug your ears and ignore the bad things around you and everything will be okay," and it's horrible advice.My apology. English isn't my native language(my country even has its own language that's nothing like English) so I must have phrased it wrong. I don't mean that you should be asympathetic about bad things and only care for what you like to see/hear. We shouldn't dwell on it especially things that can't be help. But you can choose what you take for an example I hate cigarette so I just hold my breath every times I pass by people smoking.	Sorry if this's also a terrible advice. Like I said English isn't my native language so I can't express what I want to say really well.

We're living at a time in history where you can go on the internet and talk to thousands of people about anything and nothing.		I think you should find a subreddit that you have a passion for and start making comments on new posts to encourage and help other people who share your passion. Helping other people, even by just replying to their posts on the internet, can really help you as well.
We love you tooAw, thank you. I know it's just four words but it's the best thing I've heard all day. Thank you :)
We love you more :)Aww, thank you! I love you guys the most though :D
Right back atcha buddy!I *am* your friend, guy!
Yes! Details, please! This sounds like a very interesting story.People comment regularly on channels, start discussions, develop a rapport. Eventually it becomes something more. 		Seems interesting, but it's pretty commonplace these days, and the same story that has happened all the way since caveman said hi to cavewoman. Give men and women a way to communicate, they're find a way to fuck each other.
Aaaaaah I'm not crying it's tears of joy!!!*perspiring victory moisture from your eyes.
Then its not easy. That was my point.Well, perhaps not at first, I grew up thinking my art was bad because I'm not that great of a painter, but then i started drawing cartoons instead of real stuff and found out, I'm really good at cartoons! Then I bought some books to help me with hands and eyes which got better, but that doesn't matter because cartoons are imperfect, look at the Peanuts. Charles M. Schultz couldn't draw hands but that didn't stop him from making one of the most beloved comic strips of the 20th Century. Maybe you just haven't found what your creativity wants to create yet! And the only way to do that is by trying. I believe in you!
Aw, thank you. I know it's just four words but it's the best thing I've heard all day. Thank you :)Me too! Two more words!
Aw, thank you. I know it's just four words but it's the best thing I've heard all day. Thank you :)Me too, thanks

I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.

I just want to say thank-you to u/FiftyNinetyThree and the whole community for your warm thoughts.  You had no idea it was my birthday, so it means so much more.			PS.  [This is how I feel right now thanks to all of you ](http://i.imgur.com/5ADtKwL.jpg).  Happy birthday!!

Happy birthday!!! I hope your day just keeps getting better and better until you fall asleep at night in a pile of joy. 		P.S. thank you for all your hard work mod.This is one of the best birthday wishes I have ever recieved, often my kids sneak into bed with my wife and I so it is very likely that I will, at minimum, end up sleeping next to a pile of joy :)

While I was reading your first sentence, I was literally thinking to myself, I will sacrifice any part of today to help this guy out....then I read the second line.  Thanks friendo!Here's a couple of things I like to do to have a memorable and fun evening. 	If you take public transport go an extra stop or one stop short. Go into the first market or bar. Talk to people.  If you drive take a random exit and do the same. 	Go out to that place you keep meaning to go to. Or that other place the one you were unsure about. Talk to the server staff. 	The point is expose yourself to new things. Something good usually comes from it. 
Thanks so much!!  So glad you found us, hope that you stay, looking forward to seeing you around here more and more friendo :)Happy birthday! Here's to another year of being wholesome, and hope you have a great day!

Gordon Ramsay can be wholesome too!Gordon's actually a really great guy. He gets such a bad rap because we watch him deal with supposed "experienced" people. He points out their mistakes, though he does it in a manner that seems awful (if only for the cameras), but he only does this to get people to man up to their mistakes and make it better. Hell's Kitchen is a great example, he points out when people do something wrong, but he also lets them know when they've done something "perfectly", and rewards them. Even the one's who have won Hell's Kitchen get yelled at consistently throughout the season.	Also- I've watched some of his videos when he's with his family and he's this huge teddy bear. Typical father with the dad jokes, and is so infuriatingly adorable!
Gordon Ramsay can be wholesome too!Can we take a moment to appreciate the bot that pins comments on every post. It has wished me more excelent days than people I see everyday. I hope you're having an excelent day too bot!

It always makes me happy when Gordon Ramsay tweets are posted on here, he seems like a genuinely good guy. Something like your favorite celebrity replying to you on Twitter can make someone's day :)After watching his UK stuff I can't watch the American stuff anymore. Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.
It always makes me happy when Gordon Ramsay tweets are posted on here, he seems like a genuinely good guy. Something like your favorite celebrity replying to you on Twitter can make someone's day :)He's such an ass sometimes. Then he has moments like on the season of Masterchef where Christine was a contestant. She was unsure about a dish she presented. He described it to her in loving detail because she was blind and couldn't see how beautiful it was. The kindness and tenderness he showed her in that moment felt really genuine to me.

It always makes me happy when Gordon Ramsay tweets are posted on here, he seems like a genuinely good guy. Something like your favorite celebrity replying to you on Twitter can make someone's day :)It really says a lot about US culture how much the show changed between the UK and the US versions of Kitchen Nightmares.  US is so focused on the family drama aspect and yelling matches and the UK is really focused on making people better and generally caring about getting a business to succeed.  I think they know exactly what type of audience they are generally pandering to.
It always makes me happy when Gordon Ramsay tweets are posted on here, he seems like a genuinely good guy. Something like your favorite celebrity replying to you on Twitter can make someone's day :)I think he's the way he is for the ratings. He knows when he's being an ass- which is entertaining/cringe/omg he's such a jerk! Then he has those moments where he praises ppl and it's like a "wow, he really does recognize talent" and when *he* praises someone *we* will automatically think the dish is 100x better because praises aren't given by him, unless they deserve it		With the kids he was nice, and wasn't hard on them. Definitely wholesome. Adults *should* be able to handle his critiques, if he was mean to the kids with out offering any help then viewers would be pissed off		It's all for ratings though, and he is entertaining. When we as viewers catch a chef messing up, we can't help but wait for the yelling. He doesn't even try to be sentimental, but *lashes* out		I love one bit in the kids version when a chef is crying and he tells them that his kids always cry in the kitchen, but it's from laughing and having a fun time- never from beating themselves up over something. I got chills when he said that!		EDIT: I would like point out how some shows focus on being nice, and let people down in a nice way. Ex) *The Voice* will tell people in a nice way how they have potential but aren't "ready" yet. Wholesome TV is a thing, but we kinda crave the insults because most of us wouldn't give insults like that in real life- even when we're thinking it (think Simon Cowell in *American Idol*) 
Marrying a pork loin seems like the best option at this point to be honest.Cheer up friend! You'll find the one:)

After watching his UK stuff I can't watch the American stuff anymore. Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.Yup. My favorite is the time he taught inmates how to cook and tried to get them out of the system. Even gave one a job in one of his restaurants. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy0OgDmRsRM if anyone wants to watch.
After watching his UK stuff I can't watch the American stuff anymore. Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.Totally agree. The U.K. stuff is interesting, helpful and he's kind, caring and just wants people to be their best.		Our US version just fucked everything up and made it reality tv. They introduced shitty drama and poor music cues.
After watching his UK stuff I can't watch the American stuff anymore. Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.From what I understand, he's very nice to the kids BECAUSE they are kids. They are talented, but still learning.		The adults are learned, practiced chefs making amateur mistakes, so he treats them as such.
After watching his UK stuff I can't watch the American stuff anymore. Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.It's a frustrating trend in American TV that there has to be constant drama and conflict and anger and yelling.		Speaking as an American, I've found anytime there's a British version of a TV show, and an American version, the British version is better.
After watching his UK stuff I can't watch the American stuff anymore. Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.*insert drama violin sound*
After watching his UK stuff I can't watch the American stuff anymore. Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.I like kitchen nightmares. He can sometimes still be a dick but there's usually enough material showing how he's just trying to help and genuinely wants people to succeed.
After watching his UK stuff I can't watch the American stuff anymore. Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.Don't sleep on the American stuff though you may miss episodes like Amy's Baking Company.
After watching his UK stuff I can't watch the American stuff anymore. Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.Watch that one episode where he tried American soul food in the U.K. He's really nice to this one black lady.

He described it to her in loving detail because she was blind and couldn't see how beautiful it was.

I think they know exactly what type of audience they are generally pandering to.I agree! I'm from the US, but I watched the Great Irish Bake Off from here (a spin off of the highly popular Great British Bake Off) as one of my cousins was a competitor. I remember being almost shocked at how nice everyone was! In one episode, my cousin had to make a special kind of cake she didn't know how to make. Even though it was relatively late in the season, one of her competitors helped her out. My cousin wasn't eliminated that day and ended up winning the season, thanks to some friendly advice. That sort of atmosphere doesn't even exist in the American cooking shows!
Cheer up friend! You'll find the one:)They're $3.99 a lbs at the grocery store. It's not that hard.
"Absolutely disgusting"		*hangs on wall*		*smiles*Honestly I would absolutely do that. Even the honor of being insulted by Gordon Ramsay would be amazing 
Then tweet at him with a dish you made.Make sure to either put it in a gorgeous plate, or purposefully put it on a prison tray.
I've been trying for months to cook and plate something that'd get a good response for him. Turns out it's hard to make pizza rolls on a paper plate look good :\Just haven't found the right filter yet.
I've been trying for months to cook and plate something that'd get a good response for him. Turns out it's hard to make pizza rolls on a paper plate look good :\I'd imagine he'd be really excited to hear that by responding to tweets, he's incidentally inspiring people to start cooking. I just realized I'm guilty of it.
It's not RAW!!THIS IS... Delicious.
I'm sure he probably tweets out when he has some down time (inbetween shows) Yeah it takes like 2 seconds to send a tweet.
If the president of the United States can manage, I'm sure he can too.I'd bet my nuts that Gordon Ramsay is working harder than Trump.
He also really dials it up for the American editions. If you watch the international versions he's a lot calmer, though he does still curse like a sailor.The American editions also go absolutely overboard with intense music and cuts everywhere. The UK version has Ramsay go on long periods of just talking to the people without any cuts or music. So much cozier to watch. 
He also really dials it up for the American editions. If you watch the international versions he's a lot calmer, though he does still curse like a sailor.Oh, absolutely! I love watching him fix restaurants up in London, but there's a subdued sense of his mannerisms that he saves for the Americans. Maybe as a way to "put us in our place" Or that Americans enjoy watching other Americans get cussed at by a British man?
He seriously seems like the nicest guy. I was blown away by how much he seemed to actually care about the people he helped on the show. I remember when I first watched Hell's Kitchen I couldn't understand why people liked the guy so much. 		When I saw his British work it really put the respect and loyalty people had for him into perspective
He seriously seems like the nicest guy. I was blown away by how much he seemed to actually care about the people he helped on the show. He yells at the people on hells kitchen because they think they're the shit, and they're not. When he works with kids for instance, he doesn't think the same way because, y'know, they're kids.
He seriously seems like the nicest guy. I was blown away by how much he seemed to actually care about the people he helped on the show. There came a point where certain aspects of his personality (his abraisiveness when he feels slighted, his zero tolerance for below par work, his foul mouth) became what he was known for and what the networks wanted him to play up for ratings. 		His earlier work on British TV had heart and showed his genuine passion for food and cooking. Sadly now he is expected to blow up in exaggerated fashion at least once an episode to cater for US television networks but he has always come across as a genuinely nice dude.
Totally agree. The U.K. stuff is interesting, helpful and he's kind, caring and just wants people to be their best.		Our US version just fucked everything up and made it reality tv. They introduced shitty drama and poor music cues.Oh god, the near-constant melodramatic music. Completely saps out any real emotion.
From what I understand, he's very nice to the kids BECAUSE they are kids. They are talented, but still learning.		The adults are learned, practiced chefs making amateur mistakes, so he treats them as such.I was just saying to my gf last night that if Gordon Ramsay were to walk in my house and I made him a meal he would be kind and complimentary. If I was to walk into his restaurant and make the same meal in his kitchen he would yell at me. One is about being polite and friendly the other is about craft. 		Edit: a word
It's a frustrating trend in American TV that there has to be constant drama and conflict and anger and yelling.

I like kitchen nightmares.

Don't sleep on the American stuff though you may miss episodes like Amy's Baking Company.Or NINOOOOOO
He's great with everyone. He just act super mad because apparently that's what sells in US tv market. He's actually a very caring person for everyone, his image as angry man is just for ratings.And he's passionate about what he does. While I get it's played up for the camera, I could see why he would want to strangle people trying to run a restaurant in a shitty way.

I've seen a raw video (not meant for TV) where he was very agitated and swearing in the kitchen, but it was admittedly under extreme, uncommon circumstances where anyone would be hard-pressed to keep their cool.  Other than that, everything I've seen of him outside his character is very genuine and kind.  Gordon is a good dude.
I agree! I'm from the US, but I watched the Great Irish Bake Off from here (a spin off of the highly popular Great British Bake Off) as one of my cousins was a competitor. I remember being almost shocked at how nice everyone was! In one episode, my cousin had to make a special kind of cake she didn't know how to make. Even though it was relatively late in the season, one of her competitors helped her out. My cousin wasn't eliminated that day and ended up winning the season, thanks to some friendly advice. That sort of atmosphere doesn't even exist in the American cooking shows!Nothing will compare to the day Deborah accidently stole Howard's custard, truly the greatest tragedy on TV. 
They're $3.99 a lbs at the grocery store. It's not that hard.Don't rush it, though. You've gotta find the right one. Don't just go for any old pork loin, you'll need to find one you are ready to spend your whole life with.

The American editions also go absolutely overboard with intense music and cuts everywhere. The UK version has Ramsay go on long periods of just talking to the people without any cuts or music.

You watch him gently tell people what they're doing wrong, and it's when they arrogantly continue messing things up because they think they know best, that's when they get yelled at.  The TV shows specifically choose match-ups with that kind of person in order to get the best drama (and this is more true of the American shows for various reasons).

I've always seen him like Simon Cowell. Everyone deep down really only cares what he has to say because he is respected and will give you a no fluff response.

Watch his videos of him going to Asia to learn about cooking styles. Truly humble man.I actually didn't think much of him in Vietnam, his style of humour didn't translate well with his Vietnamese hosts. He went to extreme-dish places (snake is v niche in VN)  to get an idea of VN food and was disgusted. Perhaps he has little influence over locations though. He spat out a local dish in front of a gathered crowd of villagers, I winced. 		Having said all that, I love Ramsey's shows and watching him in his element, shaping chefs and delivering truth-bombs.

And even though he's arguably one of the best chefs working, and without a doubt one of the biggest names in the culinary world, he wants to learn every facet from these people with genuine curiosity. And he does it without invading with his bullshit, trying to just take their knowledge and run or trying to take their knowledge and make it "wrong" or outdated or archaic.

"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."This is so adorable ahh!! Congrats to the happy couple <3 <3
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."This is just a great gif all around. The happiness in the father's face brightened my day!
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."What happens when your wife is creative and your friends are cops.
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."Normally I don't like pregnancy reveal posts but this was pretty fucking clever. 
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."I am almost completely emotionally unfazed to anything on the internet nowadays, but this made me smile hardcore without even realizing it!
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."I came here from r/funny to make sure this was posted here!
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat.""And here's your ticket."
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."I'm not crying. I'm just chopping some happy onions.
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."I think this is probably the only video/gif of a white cop and a black civilian that I've ever seen that didn't infuriate me. Faith in humanity restored.
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."I never understood actually saving the pregnancy test.  Like, "Look at this stick I peed on!  Look at it!"  It's possible to announce a pregnancy without it.		But that's just me rambling.  Nice video.
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."Oh damn, you made a child free person cry. This is powerful. 
"Sir, you've got a child in the car with no child seat."Cops being bros. New sub?

I'm not sure if it was combat experience or just general army life, but it's really nice to see a vet getting such great treatment and even advocacy from an officer like this!

I don't want to sound negative but what is the purpose of a gif if it's 1:43 min long?Gifs take less to download on mobile and aren't so overt in more public places or in the workplace.
I don't want to sound negative but what is the purpose of a gif if it's 1:43 min long?Because not everyone can have sound on. I can watch gifs while I work, but not videos, or the "I'm checking MSDS" excuse will stop working 
I don't want to sound negative but what is the purpose of a gif if it's 1:43 min long?Mostly because most people who browse reddit on their phones dont have headphones in or can't play it on a speaker. Also even on a computer actually going to YouTube in a new tab is a pain, and even more so on a phone
I don't want to sound negative but what is the purpose of a gif if it's 1:43 min long?99% of time time I'll never click a video, but I'll watch a gif.

I don't believe in that kind of conspiratorial bunk.  It's all market forces, honestly.  I don't disagree with you overall--the media does show more negative than positive.

I bet you and those upvotting you don't say the same about Wall St. There is TONS of good Wall St people do and did before 2008. But there was clearly a major problem with Wall St and the media focuses  on on that major issue.		So there are a lot of good cops like there are a lot of good people doing good things on wall st. However, just like Wall St ,there is a very serious issue going on with the police. Police in the US kill about 1100 people a year. In countries like Germany, they kill typically less than 10 or so a year. Across much of western Europe, it's typically in the single digits. 		I'm in no way arguing that all those 1100+ killing can be avoided, but when the number is far far far higher than other countries and nearly 0% of the cops are convicted of any serious crime, it indicates that there is a major problem with policing in the US. 				Laquan Mcdonald: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIJqDNCE2uE		 This is also perhaps the story that most explains how fucked up this situation is. Laquan McDonald, a black man shot by the police : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Laquan_McDonald		So here's the summary:		1. Oct 2014, a black 17 yr old McDonald is killed by police. An officer shot him 16 times. He was holding a 3 inch folding knife. 	2. The police didn't release the video. The state attorney general didn't press charges. The police ruled it justifiable homicide. There were SEVERAL officers present when the murder happened. The officers said the teen lunged at them with a knife after being asked to put the knife down. 	3. 13 months go by and they wont release the videos -- dashcam videos and video from a Burger King camera. 	4. A judge rules they must release the video by Dec 2015. They quietly release it Thanksgiving week. 	5. Video CLEARLY shows that McDonald was walking away, they crowded him, and he just continued walking parallel. One officer opened fired and shot at him 16 times, hitting him 9 times. 	6. Clearly everyone lied. Clearly the police tried to cover it up. Clearly the attorney general was helping in the cover up because she had a close relationship with the cops. 	7. The result? Officer FINALLY got charged with 1st degree murder ON THE FUCKING DAY THEY RELEASED THE VIDEO 13 MONTHS AFTER THE INCIDENT. The Attorney General lost re-election. The Chief of Police was fired. The mayor almost got kicked out. 			This story details how messed up the policing situation is. Everyone lies to protect dirty cops.

Hard to know if you have a preexisting bamboozle though. Okay, personal story time: 		I had a pre-existing bamboozle and I needed the bamboozle-no-more therapy being offered on Groupon.

I was livid! It's now been 3 years on and I got the bamboozle taken care of and had a surgical mesh implanted to make sure the bamboozle doesn't poke through my abdominal wall again, but damn what a hassle all over a simple bamboozle that only required a 30 minute surgery and lots of pain meds!

that's a really broad statementThe irony coming from your post is not wholesome at all. You're in a comment chain that pretty much states all white cops don't like black people.
Yeah, now that I look back at it, I guess I was a bit confused because there was no backstory and it was just a gif.Based on what we see in the video, the driver and the cop on his side are clearly friends and he immediately launches into the joke.  And then the other cop has a gift for him.  I'd say that makes it planned.

I'm just going to edit over this comment since people would rather misinterpret my point and argue over nothing. 		For people that are new to the thread and don't want to be left out, all I said was you shouldn't let those statistics affect how you judge people from that group that you meet in life. Ignore any "Facts about group (x)" when you meet someone from that group, because its better to judge them by who they are, not where they're from.		Apology for causing conflict in this thread, I just woke up when I typed my original comment. I guess I should've waited until I got some coffee or something"I reject reality and substitute it with my own."	This is why problems fail to get solved. We would rather ignore them and feel comfortable than come together in discussion about uncomfortable topics to determine a solution. Wouldn't it be better if reality were the happier alternative and not our imagined what if world?

You are undermining the experiences of countless people. I'm not saying you have to be a staunch advocate, but acknowledging that the statistics do exist for a reason is important. How would you feel about someone only seeing the negative? I think both positive and negative have a place in the world and it's not a good thing to shut yourself off from that. Isn't the good much sweeter because of the bad?			That being said, I love how you seek the positivity in everything! :D
Because most of the time, there is a probable cause.Have you counted how many black US citizens have been murdered by white cops for non-violent or no offenses? Minor traffic violations, selling cigarettes, wearing a hoodie? The disparity of how white and black Americans are treated by white cops for similar actions on average is extreme.
It's not universal, but it's true more often than not. Try going on a ride-a-long with your local PD and see for yourself what policing is like and how relations with *your* community are. The relationship between police and the community is really good in my area. I lived in San Jose and the police were horrible and I was afraid of them. Just walking down the street I would be harassed. I now live in a small town near Sacramento and the police are the best. I have gotten to know some of them and they have a very good relationship with the community. So just from my experiences it depends on where you live. Might differ in other people's experiences. Police culture is different depending on where you go. I don't think this is that controversial.

Turns out, SPD are pretty much exactly as bad as everyone thinks they are. At least, the interactions I saw were very racially charged and her uncle is kind of a dick on top of that. I didn't see any actual violence, but he definitely targeted minorities for traffic stops and was verbally aggressive and physically intimidating towards them.

Kindness.A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.		"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."		The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.		Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.

We tried to give him a few dollars, or just a bite to eat in the lunch room, but he wouldn't take a dime. The lady and I have tried to find that old man for a gift. But I haven't seen him since :C

Kindness.How did she do that? I'd like to know more about this.

And when  he tried to get up, there he saw the lion coming towards him.		> Instead of attacking him it kept on moaning and groaning and looking at Androcles, who saw that the lion was holding out his right paw, which was covered with blood and very much swollen. Looking more closely at it, Androcles saw a great big thorn pressed into the paw, which was the cause of all the lions trouble.		> Plucking up courage, he seized hold of the thorn and drew it out of the lions paw, who roared with pain when the thorn came out, but soon after found such relief from it that he rubbed up against Androcles, and showed  that he knew, that he was truly thankful for being relieved from such pain.		> One day, a number of soldiers came marching through the forest and found Androcles. They took him prisoner and brought him back to the town, and he was condemned to death because he had fled from his master.		> Now it used to be the custom to throw murderers and other criminals to the lions,  and on the appointed day he was led forth into the arena.		> The Emperor of Rome was in the royal box that day and gave the signal for the lion to come out and attack Androcles. But when it came out of its cage and got near Androcles, what do you think it did? Instead of jumping upon him, it rubbed up against him, and stroked him with its paw.		> It was of course the lion which Androcles had met in the forest. The Emperor summoned Androcles to him. So Androcles told the Emperor all that had happened to him and how the lion was showing gratitude for his having relieved it of the thorn. Thereupon, the emperor pardoned Androcles and ordered his master to set him free, while the lion was taken back into the forest and let loose to enjoy freedom once more.		In the version I read in Latin, Androcles took refuge in a cavern where the lion lived, and there's where the thorn thing happened. Then they lived there together for a few years before Androcles was captured after leaving the cave. And when they were set free, they roamed the streets together, and the townspeople said "there goes the lion who is a host to the man, and the man who is a doctor to the lion".

This is a really nice story, and I can appreciate the sacrifices that the good samaritans do, but I really don't like how the OP of that seems to *expect* cars to stop to help others. While it can certainly be helpful beyond words to assist some people, it can also be dangerous and puts the would-be helpers in a very vulnerable situation. Nobody is in the wrong for not stopping to help people they don't know. It would be an outright shame for a naive person to end up hurt or worse. 		To be clear, I'm not trying to dissuade folks from helping others. I just don't want to see it *expected* of others because of the very real possibility of danger involved. And that's why people don't stop. Thoughts like those expressed in your post. I'm not criticising you - you're a product of your society. Those Mexicans were a product of theirs.		I rarely stop to help people myself, but I lived in rural Ireland for a while and caught a flat. After five minutes of starting to change the tire, there was a line of three or four stopped cars beside mine, all trying to help me.

Everything will be okay.There's a roughly 15 year age gap between my little Sister and I. When she was a toddler, I was in the shittier part of late-stage adolesance. I was unemployed, living at home, and had an awful sleep schedule. I'd often be awake all night and sleep in the slday. Because of this, Id often do the morning shift of sorting out my Sister's breakfast and what not to give my Mum some extra snooze time.		One morning, I'm not doing very well. Battered from a generally unhealthy lifestyle and no doubt extra weakened by fatigue, I'm stood in the kitchen to pour her some cereal while she watched TV in the living room. For reasons I cant remember, I just start sobbing. Probably over nothing, just one of those times you need to cry.		She comes tottering into the kitchen and asks in her toddler proto-speak "what's wrong?". I do my best to hide it but she can tell. She tots over and gives me a hug, and it was almost enough to set me off again.		I dont know if it was because she was my Sister but the fact that a little babby who can barely walk or talk can tell whats up and know that you need a hug was pretty amazing to me. 
Everything will be okay.I had this happen to me. Baby on the metro was reaching for my hand, so I just lifted my index finger for baby to reach, baby caught it and started giggling furiously. Instantly made me jollier... then baby tried to put my finger in mouth... Babies are adorably stupid.

Kids don't care about how you feel because they lack any empathy. I speak subjectively, but the children I work day to day with dont care about how I or my fellow staff feel because what they're interested in is fulfilling their desires. There are those who will be loving and caring because they are making the honest effort to be that way and they will make you feel good during your tough situations, but they aren't doing so because they're "in tune" with emotions. They're doing it because that's how they want to be. We give too much credit to kids. If by chance they know you're not feeling okay, they'll act on it just as proportionately as some adult would. Excuse me for being pessimistic about it. I love working with children but to continue I've had to forsake the idea that children are inherently good. Really what it comes down to are environment and household experiences for children, which are out of our control.

Depression can be rough but it's a lot better with something to enjoy and look forward to every day. The really rough part is when things aren't possible to be viewed in that light.  My depression wasn't really tied to my day to day life as it was to struggling with existence itself.		I know 'it gets better' is beyond cliche, but for me it did.  It may have taken not only days, months, but years to get better, but it did.  		During that time, the last vestige of a general 'looking forward to' thing was for me the mystery of life and search for meaning even if I felt empty at times.

The really rough part is when things aren't possible to be viewed in that light.  My depression wasn't really tied to my day to day life as it was to struggling with existence itself.		I know 'it gets better' is beyond cliche, but for me it did.  It may have taken not only days, months, but years to get better, but it did.  		During that time, the last vestige of a general 'looking forward to' thing was for me the mystery of life and search for meaning even if I felt empty at times.  I didn't want leave a universe filled with endless wonder and questions, I still wanted to stay and explore.		That's what kept me and still keeps me here.  		I'm sorry if this comment didn't seem totally wholesome, but when people were honest to me in that time it made me feel the best.I was diagnosed with depression a few days ago after repeated breakdowns, loss of focus in day to day activities, motivation to get out of bed, intense mood swings, and a lack of sleep, eating, etc. I've had a lot of tough times in my life, but this past 3 months has been the hardest. 		For some reason what you said touched me; something finally made sense to me. And I want to say thank you for it.

I'm really happy that you found something worth sticking around a ~~whole~~ while for :) It gives me hope that one day I can find my way out of the darkness.

I mean sure they feel good when theyre together but when theyre apart its not like it fades away. The depression is still there. My current girlfriend who I love is still dealing with depression despite the fact we have amazing time together. 		This feeling that depression comes from loneliness is untrue I know a ton of people in very happy relationships where they or their partner is dealing with depression and cant escape it.		However this is a wholesome memes post so thats a cute doggo and I hope your friend finds happiness with himself and the girl.

I believe the tone of the post is "im just dandy over here with my fairy wings, so I'm slyly congratulating you and giving my nod of pride"I believe friends are what gets us through life. I'm thinking of one dude in particular who got me through a lot. I wish for everyone to have someone like my friend in their life.
That's true, but I can tell you that having someone to be there for you to make you feel less alone definitely helps.Oh definitely. But I feel too many teenagers and people in their 20s think that theyre sad because theyre not in a relationship where their sadness stems from some part of them.		Its also can be a bit of a burden on your SO in that they are the source of your happiness. which shouldnt be true no one should have that burden to bear. 
Good to remember for when dogs bite or when bees sting.Or when you're feeling sad
Good to remember for when dogs bite or when bees sting.Bees don't sting unless you fuck with them. Bees are your bros. Bees take care of your garden and all the plants down at the park. Bees are cool and make us honey. Bees are hard working little oompa loompas who just want to be left alone. 		Wasps on the other hand... Wasps exist solely to ruin everyone's day.

I actually learned that about bees a few years ago. Before, I was quite scared of them. Now, I know that if I'm chill, they're chill.I would feel weird saying this anywhere but here- I used to have severe apiphobia. I think the first time I actually felt like a real parent was when I bushed a bee off my kid and I had to go in the house and shake for a bit from adrenaline. 		So three years ago I read about tired bees and how they may need water or sugar.  Two years ago a bee landed on my skirt and for a minute or two I just froze. She just sat there, patiently. 		The material was somewhat water resistant, so I shakily poured a little water onto my lap, curling up the fabric a bit to make a little bee drinking pool. She had a drink of water, bumbled around my lap, then eventually flew off.		I'm not scared of bumblebees now. It was a good way to confront my fear.
Well, fuckin' a.I like to use the word 'fuck' to bridge thoughts together. For example, this title is awfully specific ...fuuucking... you okay OP?
It's really not.It's Jeremiah Johnson, mountain man.

I so want to cut all the Drax laughs once I have the film (saw it in the cinema already)... Haha^Haha^Haha^HahaPretty much the only scene with him I didn't like was the initial ~~mind~~emotion-reading scene. I didn't like that scene in the trailer or the movie. Drax was still the best part of that scene, though. 
Yeah. Best part is that he's so fucking funny, but the movie shows that he has a lot of sadness inside too.Like with those "practical jokes" he invented
Yeah. Best part is that he's so fucking funny, but the movie shows that he has a lot of sadness inside too.You could see a huge improvement in his acting too, probably why they weren't afraid to show his darker side.
