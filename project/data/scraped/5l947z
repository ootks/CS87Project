I hope you're happy :)I'm happy because you want us to be happy, and now I want you to be happy! c:
I hope you're happy :)> You really think someone would do that? Just go on the Internet and make people happy?		Here's to a wholesome 2017.  `(:`
I hope you're happy :)[deleted]
I hope you're happy :)You're also bringing more people into the Love shack. I've seen enough of these on /r/all that I finally subscribed.   
I hope you're happy :)I hope I've made you happy!
I hope you're happy :)It's new year's eve, I have mad temperature and my cough kills me.  	I live in a dorm and all my friends have gone home. This is the first new year I will meet alone.  	But at least I know that this year I tried to be the best person to everyone around me. I know I have improved someone's life and it makes me endlessly happy.  	  	Happy New Year everyone! 
I hope you're happy :)I feel like I'm not even nice enough to comment on this sub. You guys are too awesome! 
I hope you're happy :)I hope everyone has a wholesome day!
I hope you're happy :)I'm doing my part!
I hope you're happy :)Spread the happiness ! 
I hope you're happy :)Why thank you. I am happy. This sub is such a great place it is honestly hard not to be happy. When I see a negative comment I can't help but think how hard they had to work for that negativity in here. 		It is strange to think how much energy we can waste on negativity when it is so much easier and healthier to be positive about things. 
I hope you're happy :)It's already 2017 in Australia now. Have a new year folks! I'm so happy (but also bittersweet because today is the birthday of my late dad) being here! You get an upvote, you get an upvote, you all get an upvote!!		()	
I hope you're happy :)I even upvote the non-wholesome comments because they deserve to be happy too! 
I hope you're happy :)its the new me_irl
I hope you're happy :)This sub is great :) Always cheers me up when I feel down.
I hope you're happy :)Omg thank you that made me feel so warm inside. This is the side of reddit I want!
I hope you're happy :)Something inside me really hopes that this sub takes off in 2017. But that it also keeps its friendliness and down to earth nature as it's grows. 		I just saw the new year in here in Australia, and I'm feeling so excited about it. 		I hope anyone really this has a Great new years eve. And a great new year too. I love you all :) xxx
I hope you're happy :)J A J A J A J A
I hope you're happy :)2016 RULES!!
I hope you're happy :)I just had a lovely dinner with my family, my bro in law made a great stew, and my baby nephew was adorable. I'm all primped up and ready to welcome my own guests, have some drinks, and say goodbye to 2016, which was difficult for many, and brought many good things to me. This is the first year in a long time that NY doesn't feel like an abstract thing, this year has felt like a project that I have finally brought to a close. Better mental health, employment, new and old friends entered my life. 		I hope the next year is kind to you all. 
I hope you're happy :)I have started up-voting positive comments everywhere to combat all those pesky meanies.
I hope you're happy :)[removed]
I hope you're happy :)I'm late to this, but I browse /r/all basically exclusively. I get the "best" of all the subs. I'm almost *always* stone faced going from title to title, picture to picture, video to video, etc.		But not here. Y'all stop me dead in my tracts and make this face smile. This sub is so friggin awesome. The people in this sub are friggin awesome. **You** people are friggin awesome.		Thanks for all the smiles.
I hope you're happy :)How does this have 1.8k karma but only 10 comments?
I hope you're happy :)I appreciate all of you guys.
I hope you're happy :)Hello friendos. I honestly didn't mean for or expect this to take off like it did. I didn't make it to "karma whore" (I don't even know what the purpose of karma is, I'm not that avid a reddit user) I just wanted to make a nice wholesome post for this sub. Have a nice day :D
I hope you're happy :)The best thing is it wont actually affect the quality of the post that reach the top either because youre giving them all equal vote. Everyone wins
I hope you're happy :)I mean yeah I get that the theme is wholesomeness and happiness but this is just straight up karmawhoring r/adviceanimals shit.
I hope you're happy :)I hOPe you Are So having an aweSome day!
I hope you're happy :)Why do people downvote anyway? Just move on if you don't like what's said. Upvoting is better!
I hope you're happy :)Sorry to be the negative one but the karma whoring is already happening here. Didn't take long to ruin a nice idea.		It also already seems forced or sarcastic in the comments rather than genuine. 		Maybe im just a dick, dammit Scott.
I hope you're happy :)I wouldn't want pity upvotes. Would you? If so, why?
I hope you're happy :)Maybe I'm wrong, but aren't these memes meant to be funny. This is wholesome, but also kind of bogus. 
I hope you're happy :)Karma whoring

Sorry to be the negative one but the karma whoring is already happening here. Didn't take long to ruin a nice idea.		It also already seems forced or sarcastic in the comments rather than genuine. 		Maybe im just a dick, dammit Scott.Yep, it only took a week to go from a nice positive place to a subreddit completely about itself.
I'm like Oprah with the updoots when it comes to my wholesomememes famyo get the updoots
Karma whoringit's the best kind of whoring don't you think?? :D

What if someone went to this sub and made a nasty non-wholesome comment? On one hand you want to make that person happy, but on the other one that person is making people unhappy. And deleting his comment would also make him unhappy.		Checkmate /r/wholesomemes, now upvote me because I've upvoted you all ()What if I don't just delete your comment but leave you a wholesome poem of encouragement and, then follow up with a PM asking how your day was and if there's anything I can do to help you?

So removing a comment could make the troll happy.  	  	  		*May everyone's 2017 be full of everything they need!* 
How did you make the text green? I've been meaning to do some nifty reddit formatting, but I'm not sure about colors and fonts mainly.		I can do links and stuff, and I'm familiar with the concept of escape characters.The green comes from this subreddit's CSS.  All I did was use the "quote" feature of Markdown where you begin the line with an angle bracket, `>`.
I'm worried we're jinxing 2017 really hard :(Well, I suppose it all depends on how one looks at things.  If the world could spend more time focusing on the positive aspects of life than it inevitably spends on the negative, we would have the motivation and encouragement to truly make a difference for the betterment of all.		So, try not to let cynicism prevent you from making the most of the next year.  `(:`
I, as well. This is sub is a shining beacon in a world of darkness.It's quite refreshing. 
1,790 people wanted to make op happy (:I bet OP is also happy that his inbox didn't blow up. OP is happy, we are happy, another good day in r/wholesomememes
we need a /r/wholesomecirclejerk nowI thought this already was /r/circlejerk
I bet you've got one heck of a good grandma.She broke her hip but she is recovering nicely, il post a picture so you know how wonderful she's doing!
I bet you've got one heck of a good grandma.Heckin good gran
My grandma is happy that your grandma is happy that I am happyThat's a hoot
What if I don't just delete your comment but leave you a wholesome poem of encouragement and, then follow up with a PM asking how your day was and if there's anything I can do to help you?Well how could anyone be upset with that plan. Brilliant. This sub makes my day everyday I come here. I need to come here everyday. 		PM me asking me how my day was. 
The green comes from this subreddit's CSS.  All I did was use the "quote" feature of Markdown where you begin the line with an angle bracket, `>`.green is a happy color, so it's green because if you're quoting somebody on here it's a happy quote! :)
I thought this already was /r/circlejerkIt's kind of a genuine circlejerk, instead of satirical.
She broke her hip but she is recovering nicely, il post a picture so you know how wonderful she's doing!I hope she recovers soon, happy new year
She broke her hip but she is recovering nicely, il post a picture so you know how wonderful she's doing!You love the shit out of your grandma. I just lost mine in august.
It's kind of a genuine circlejerk, instead of satirical.Lol feels more organic
I hope she recovers soon, happy new yearThanks I posted a picture of her!
You love the shit out of your grandma. I just lost mine in august.Yeah I try to spend as much time as I can with her. But I can't to often.
Yeah I try to spend as much time as I can with her. But I can't to often.I understand that. I lived 5 hours away from mine and I didn't see near as often as I would have liked.
