Definitely a good boy"Okay, hoomans, push! Puuuush!"
Definitely a good boySo not too long after I adopted this pitbull (mix?) we had days of heavy winter rain and I was dismayed to find water coming in under the wall in the garage/bottom floor.  Dismayed because now I have to soldier-crawl around in the muck in the crawl space and hand-dig dirt that had built up around the foundation so this water will drain.  And btw, it's around 40F (cold for here!) and I didn't have any kind of gear for that kind of shit.		It was when she started crawling around behind me, digging just as I was that I saw that yes, she really was a good girl.  It was cute as hell.
Definitely a good boyHe's hoping to be rewarded with a ride in the truck, playing the long game.
Definitely a good boyWhenever I'm digging in the yard, my pit comes over and proceeds to "assist" me by moving the dirt all around in the bottom of the hole.  She puts on a good show and I always give her high praise for helping out.

Definitely a good boyHe's standing like that because he'd drown otherwise. Or at least have to swim. 
Do you think he knows he's a dog?No and that is beautiful.
Do you think he knows he's a dog?He knows he's part of the pack.   He knows some pack members have two legs and do weird stuff sometimes but he doesn't hold it against them, he knows they mean well.
Do you think he knows he's a dog?LANA! He thinks he's people! 
Do you think he knows he's a dog?Jim...Jim!! Turn the wheel to the left....I saw a squirrel

That's me in real life; I try to help, though I have no idea what I'm doing.Whenever my dad and I had to do work on our house, he'd always say, "I have no idea what I'm doing, but we'll get it done."		Thankfully he did have a far better idea than what I would be doing.
That's my spirit animal, getting that A for the effort!One of the few times a spirit animal is actually an animal :)
What is this letterbox picture format OP opened the post somewhere else then took a screenshot of the picture... \\\_()_/
What is this letterbox picture format Crop so bad it started a famine.
"Okay, hoomans, push! Puuuush!">"Okay, hoomans, push! Puuuush!"		Sounds like the dog is in the delivery room of a hospital.		"Mazel tov! It's a girl! Erm...I mean...*woof woof*."
Whenever I'm digging in the yard, my pit comes over and proceeds to "assist" me by moving the dirt all around in the bottom of the hole.  She puts on a good show and I always give her high praise for helping out.That is when you know you're digging this pit.

[On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Internet_dog.jpg)Got damn, that comic takes me back to 1997, 20 years ago when it was probably published. 
I know the feeling! :)		(source: am in work meeting)Also in a work meeting. Started here a month ago. No clue 
I know the feeling! :)		(source: am in work meeting)If you want to know what you're doing friendo, you should pay attention in your meeting!! :)
I know the feeling! :)		(source: am in work meeting)Well, a first step would be not to be on the phone during your meeting and listen. :)
Whenever my dad and I had to do work on our house, he'd always say, "I have no idea what I'm doing, but we'll get it done."		Thankfully he did have a far better idea than what I would be doing.Can confirm, am dad now.  Have no idea what I'm doing.  Usually get it done anyway.
Whenever my dad and I had to do work on our house, he'd always say, "I have no idea what I'm doing, but we'll get it done."		Thankfully he did have a far better idea than what I would be doing.I think that's an important thing to share with children in parenting. It makes trying and doing things less intimidating.
>"Okay, hoomans, push! Puuuush!"		Sounds like the dog is in the delivery room of a hospital.		"Mazel tov! It's a girl! Erm...I mean...*woof woof*."-Did that dog just say woof?		-What do you mean, all dogs say woof. 		-No, dogs usually just bark. This sounded like someone saying woof. 		
do you dig when your pit digs the pit that you're digginHow much pit could a pit dig if a pit could dig pits?
I bet he knows he's a good boy though.http://i.imgur.com/oSiajTF.jpg
Got damn, that comic takes me back to 1997, 20 years ago when it was probably published. [It'll be 24](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/nobody-knows-youre-a-dog-as-iconic-internet-cartoon-turns-20-creator-peter-steiner-knows-the-joke-rings-as-relevant-as-ever/2013/07/31/73372600-f98d-11e2-8e84-c56731a202fb_blog.html) in a few months! Older than a substantial chunk of internet users. 
Also in a work meeting. Started here a month ago. No clue Wow that's a long meeting.
Can confirm, am dad now.  Have no idea what I'm doing.  Usually get it done anyway.I like this because we all go into adulthood so scared and confused but it's comforting to remember your parents and every other adult out there has once felt or still feels the same way.
-Did that dog just say woof?		-What do you mean, all dogs say woof. 		-No, dogs usually just bark. This sounded like someone saying woof. 		Don't be silly. Everyone knows dogs can't talk. Take it from me, I'm a dog.				Well, you would know best, I guess.
