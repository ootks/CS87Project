2017 moodWow, me and my boyfriend have our flaws, and we always say stuff like, "how do you put up with me" "I'm sorry I'm a mess this week, depression has been getting to me ". I need to work on this thanks for sharing! 
2017 moodKinda BS though. The reason you say sorry is to acknowledge your fuck up. Saying "Thanks for waiting for me" implies that you appreciate the person waiting for you, but you have no intention to change your ways. 
2017 moodI like this. My girlfriend is always getting upset with me because I apologize too much for things I don't need to apologize for. I'll try this. :)
2017 moodIf you do this too often it's going to start sounding passive aggressive. There's nothing wrong with apologizing IMO.
2017 moodThis is excellent advice for anyone with low self-esteem, anxiety, or any of that bad shit. Apologising to people makes them complicit in your negative opinion of yourself/your actions! 
2017 moodThe "thank you" implies that they're willing to put up with what you're doing-- quite the assumption. "I'm sorry" is more humble, less intrusive. It's arrogant and wrong to assert yourself in the way you plan to in 2017. I daresay this level of arrogance is indeed *very much* how 2017 will play out.		edit: **GOD HAVE MERCY ON THE VICE-RIDDEN SCOUNDRELS WHO DO NOT HEED MY WARNING!**		edit2: this subreddit is dedicated to improving the lives of people, but it's only sewing the seeds for further confusion and strife.
2017 moodEh, this isn't for me to be honest, it reminds me of cynical service industry weasel words to avoid any responsibility. If you have something to apologise for it's a good idea to do it, and I'd rather hear 'sorry I'm late' than 'thanks for waiting', because it's sort of a way get out of apologising.
2017 moodI don't know. This is basically saying "I've stopped apologizing for bad behavior and started thanking people for tolerating my bad behavior. And I feel so much better!"     	It's probably better to feel a little bad when you do things you shouldn't. Hopefully it will make you want to *stop doing that*. Definitely thank other people, but do it as well, not instead.

Kinda BS though. The reason you say sorry is to acknowledge your fuck up. Saying "Thanks for waiting for me" implies that you appreciate the person waiting for you, but you have no intention to change your ways. "Thanks for waiting for me! I had every intention to be on time but there was a wreck on the highway." Seems reasonable to me. 		"Thanks for waiting for me! I kept snoozing my alarm because I knew you'd be here no matter what." Different story. 
Kinda BS though. The reason you say sorry is to acknowledge your fuck up. Saying "Thanks for waiting for me" implies that you appreciate the person waiting for you, but you have no intention to change your ways. My girlfriend says sorry about pretty much everything, even small pointless things, so it kind of ruins the meaning of it. I don't think the person is meaning never say sorry, I think they're saying only apologize for things that actually deserve apologizing for and that you have intent to change. Cause when she apologize for having me drive over there often cause she doesn't like snow driving, or apologizes for 'making' me pay for her dinner, when those are really things I chose to do, 1: it undermines what I do for her and makes me feel unappreciated and 2: makes it so that when she apologizes for something warranted I don't feel like it's sincere and I don't feel like she intends to improve it. 
If you do this too often it's going to start sounding passive aggressive. There's nothing wrong with apologizing IMO.Time, place, tone, the people involved, all important factors to consider. :)
Eh, this isn't for me to be honest, it reminds me of cynical service industry weasel words to avoid any responsibility. If you have something to apologise for it's a good idea to do it, and I'd rather hear 'sorry I'm late' than 'thanks for waiting', because it's sort of a way get out of apologising.I think this is aimed at people who apologize for everything. I think if you're late to class or an appointment it's appropriate to apologize but if you're just a few minutes late meeting a friend for coffee or something "thanks for waiting" would be more appreciated than "sorry for being late" as it shows you don't need constant reassurance. It's for people who always feel like they're being a burden to help get them out of that frame of mind. 
I don't know. This is basically saying "I've stopped apologizing for bad behavior and started thanking people for tolerating my bad behavior. And I feel so much better!"     	It's probably better to feel a little bad when you do things you shouldn't. Hopefully it will make you want to *stop doing that*. Definitely thank other people, but do it as well, not instead.There are definitely people who compulsively apologize for things nobody really expects them to apologize for, and it just ends up making everyone kind of uncomfortable. I think this advice is more aimed at that kind of thing and not saying "never apologize ever".
Which meme exactly is this a wholesome version of?		I'm not sure I was aware of the "posting text on tumblr" meme.Not every post is a remix of another meme. I do enjoy those though :)

No job is meaningless! You provided a necessary service and earned very necessary money! But it sounds like you've found an even better job, so congrats on that! :)To add to your excellent point... It's never meaningless, you gained experience doing that job, it may not be trade skills, or learning how to program a database for example but perhaps you've learned how to deal with bad customers, decipher what managers say and what they mean etc. 		You gained experience and that's one thing that nobody can take away from you.

There are definitely people who compulsively apologize for things nobody really expects them to apologize for, and it just ends up making everyone kind of uncomfortable. I think this advice is more aimed at that kind of thing and not saying "never apologize ever".Fair. It's because "I'm sorry' is an overloaded phrase. We mean it as:     	- Please don't be mad.    	- You are overreacting.    	- Your agression has made me want to stop discussing this.      	- Oh well.     	- **** off.    	- I regret that.    	- I submit.    	-  I won't do that again.    	- I didn't do anything wrong, but I don't want this fight.     	- I sympathize.     	- That's horrible.     	- You were just rude and I'm going to give you chance to reword that.    	- I didn't hear you.    		And so on.     	     	I advocate using I'm sorry to only mean this: "I did something I shouldn't do, I regret it. I recognize and wish I hadn't caused you pain/inconvience, and I will try wholeheartedly to never do that again.".       	If you mean that, then apologize. Otherwise say what you really mean (nicely).    	 	... Although come to think of it a person would probably rather hear that. So just always say what you mean (nicely).
I love you :)I love you too!
