Wholesome artMy husband was hesitant to paint because he's red-green colorblind, but then he saw the artwork from this colorblind artist, [George Peebles](http://gpeebles.com), and now he paints, too.		We have a few differences in opinion about his color choices now and then, though. ;)
Wholesome artBob Ross is one of the most wholesome people to have walked this earth. So kind
Wholesome artYou know, I grew up watching Bob Ross and never appreciated how great he was. My fiance and I have started the show back up recently as a nice way to relax before bed. I am just in awe of not only the talent Ross possessed, but also his tips that went beyond painting (to me):		"You can't have light without darkness"	"We shouldn't seek out to destroy, but to diffuse"	"Trees can cover a multitude of sins" 		There are SO many other ones too...And maybe he WAS just talking about painting, but I believe they are truly great metaphors for life.		PS Sorry this ended up being so long.
Wholesome artI'm always impressed when I remember that Bob Ross was a master sergeant in the air force, where he screamed at people and was mean like sergeants are supposed to, but in stead of that making him bitter and authoritarian, he vowed never to scream again after his military service and became the loving and patient beacon of happiness we know and love

Wholesome artI've been painting along with Bob recently! Here's my [7th painting.](http://imgur.com/gallery/1vq9V) 
Wholesome artBob Ross was such a wonderful man
Wholesome art[I painted this painting!](http://imgur.com/a/mzNA9)		I wanted to try a Bob Ross, and figured the black and white one had to be easy to start with. And it was. A couple hours of painting got me this, pretty proud of it!
Wholesome artI am legally blind. My vision is 20/400. That means that you can see something 20 feet away that I have to be 1 foot away to see it. I wanted to go to college for art, because I've always loved to draw and I love to learn. The student counselor urged me to pick a different degree. I calmly told him I had made up my mind. The art history teacher told me he didn't think I would be able to analyze famous paintings in any meaningful way. I showed him a small telescopic device I used and described the painting he was using as an example in exhaustive detail. I told him to grade me the same as anyone else. (I ended up getting As in both classes I took from him, plus he kept a paper I wrote on the Greek statute Discupolis to read to future classes.). The advanced drawing teacher told me she felt it was wrong for me to be in her class because my best work would be inferior to other students average work. Drawing classes always put people's work up on the wall grouped by how good it is. It soon became apparent that I was one of the best in the class. I finally got my associates degree in Fine Arts. With Higher Honors. I also got a certificate degree in graphic design. It's one of the things I'm most proud of in my life. Several experts tried to say I couldn't be an artist. I excelled in spite of them.		TL;DR college professors told me a blind person would fail out of an Art degree. I showed everyone otherwise.

Anyways, one of the activities was to paint what we saw on the drive to the school that morning. I went off painting the best goddamn houses and the best grass you've ever seen in your life. Eventually, one of the supervisors came around and asked me, "Um, why is the grass brown?" Fuck. Quickly thought on my feet and replied, "...it's dead."		I can only assume I got damaged-artist-points, because I got the acceptance letter a couple months later :)

I have a friend I went to school (photography) with who is colorblind and only sees browns, yellows and blues (no idea what that type is called though) and he's a really good photographer regardless.

[removed]I think his idea behind it was that if you're painting in monochrome, colorblindness doesn't even come into play.
[removed]It doesn't quite come across in screenshots, but the episode was about someone who thought he shouldn't paint with Bob's technique because non-colorblind viewers would see it differently. Making it monochromatic is one way to fix that.		These days we'd probably encourage a colorblind painter to just go ahead and paint in color anyway and produce something that gives non-colorblind viewers some sense of what it might be like to be colorblind. That was not the goal of this episode.
[removed]That wasn't the point. 
[removed]Maybe he was just trying to be super-inclusive, or give a super basic portrayal like, "you can paint with whatever colors you have available, even if its just a pair of black and white paints."
[removed]Yeah it's not that this is what a landscape looks to a colorblind person. It's that this landscape looks the same to everyone no matter what colors you can see. 
[removed]I think he means that no matter what kind of colorblind you are the picture will still look right
[removed]I mean it depends on the color blindness but I'm pretty sure monochromacy is super rare.

He also has a lot of stuff on NetflixYeah, I just saw that recently! It's great, because I can plug my headphones into the Roku remote and drift off to sleepytime listening to his honeyed voice and the *pt-t-t-t-t* of him beatin' the devil out that brush! :)
What do they have to watch if they dont do well?Being denied Bob is punishment in itself. 
Have you ever wondered what it would have been like to be in the same room with Bob Ross and Mr. Rogers?		That's the wholesomest thing I can imagine.That or they fight it out Highlander style for the title of Most Wholesome.

Have you ever wondered what it would have been like to be in the same room with Bob Ross and Mr. Rogers?		That's the wholesomest thing I can imagine.My heart grew three sizes just thinking about it.
Your parents probably love you regardless. If they don't we definitely do.I absolutely adore this sub for this exact reason. It probably took you no time to write this comment, but you made dozens of people, including me, smile. This sub is *filled* with people like you. Its incredible.
You deserve life :-) I bet your parents can't imagine their life without you!My mom always said that none of us were accidents, but a couple were happy little surprises. 
Ya I learned quickly that it wasn't a big deal at all! Just a mountain out of a molehillI once played World of Warcraft with a red/green colorblind guy, I didn't know until after I'd been playing with him over a year because it never mattered until one specific boss fight where there were red and green slimes and we had to be careful of what ground markers we used and call things out to make sure he could kill them. Nothing else seemed to impair him in the game before then. 		I just wanted to share that in general, as it was my first experience with someone who was colorblind and it was just interesting to me. Glad things are no biggie for you :3

a lot of people think Van Gogh was colorblind because of his color palette.		http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/was-vincent-van-gogh-color-blind-it-sure-looks-like-it-27576085/Others believe he was a [synesthete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia)!

[removed]He wasn't making any scientific statements whatsoever...
[removed]He literally said he painted in gray to show you don't have to be able to see *any* colors to be able to paint.  That's literally his words.  There's no way a literate person interprets that as a scientific statement.

And Twitch still does the Mini Marathons to watch with an audience.		https://www.twitch.tv/bobrossIf Bob was still alive today, I could totally see him using twitch or YouTube to have live painting sessions if he didn't have a tv show to do it on.

That or they fight it out Highlander style for the title of Most Wholesome. but instead of anime style destruction, they leave nothing but altruistic changes in their wake. turning entire blocks of ghetto into examples of educational, safe, and opprotunistic havens in a single compliment. a peice of good natured advice, politely spoken to one another, has the capability to send a shockwave of repair that fixes all public infrastructure within a 5 mile radius.

I'm not making things political here, but imagine what the world would be like if people like Bob Ross and Mr. Rogers were in charge.

I'm not making things political here, but imagine what the world would be like if people like Bob Ross and Mr. Rogers were in charge.

Even Obama, nice guy that he is, had the ruthlessness to expand the drone striking program so that he could assassinate his enemies abroad as easily as we downvote a post. Even Bernie Sanders, who literally has been trying to save the world since the 60's, has a long as fuck shitlist of people he is trying to take down and jail. Nice people don't play this game. People who are willing to live in a constant state of conflict, whose natural state is combative, who believe that the ends justify the means, they play this game.
