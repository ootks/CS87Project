While this might not be the subreddit to voice this, you can be "caught for cheating" without actually cheating. Some people have just been hurt too many times to trust someone even when they speak the truth.Yep, girlfriend got ditched at her own wedding and found out she was being cheated on since week 1 of a 5 year relationship. If I'm browsing my phone and smiling, or on the phone in the middle of the night, she comes to be bawling her eyes out or even worse goes into a full on panic attack. Simply smiling at some wholesome memes or talking to my cousin on the other side of the world can just trigger her mind to race a million miles an hour but all I can do is comfort her, explain the situation and take care of her. Be it through the day or when she's having a bad dream at 4 am, all I can do is console her and love her through these unfortunate moments, I don't think she will ever get through such a traumatic experience unfortunately.

This is an extremely wholesome comment. This sub is great Yeah, a bit TOO wholesome. You know, quiet village in the woods wholesome. And then it turns out all the folk in there are happy little cannibals.
Exactly my point about this post. I don't know what you said in your [removed] comment, but let me tell you what this meme means to me.		Don't feel you need to lie to people to impress them.		Don't make up a narrative about yourself that is full of exaggerations or lies to feel like the kind of person people would like.		Don't fake your resume and don't promise people something you can't deliver.		*Because a person with integrity doesn't lie to manipulate people.*		We're all vulnerable to temptation to tell lies or self-aggrandize but honestly the coolest people are the one's that are just comfortable with themselves and make other people comfortable.		As it relates to "cheating on your girl", life gets too complicated when you start telling lies that need to become your reality to get away with bigger lies. It takes a lot of work to keep up that kind of charade, and you are always one slip-up away from your whole house of cards collapsing.		The simplest backstory is the one that's true. If you accept your own reality, it's absolutely the best one for you to maintain a wholesome sense of integrity. People love that. The pleasure you get from connecting with others in an honest way is the best sense of personal freedom you can have.		To me the meme is suggesting that the best way to avoid drama in your life is to stop infecting your own life with drama because you think it somehow makes your life more interesting. 		Don't unnecessarily make your own life more difficult. 		This meme is a valuable, and wholesome, life lesson.

If it helps the funniest Monte Python bits for me are "The Ministry of Silly Walks" and "The Funniest Joke in the World" I honestly think that Monty Python has to be watched as a whole, rather than individual sketches. I mean, of course the individual sketches can be funny, but a lot of the surreal humor that makes them so famous comes from their show as a whole. Quite often they would make their show appear to finish early, In one episode they ran the end credits after literally one sketch. Other times they would play nearly the entire show as a single long sketch, then run the opening credits near the very end. Quite often they would do links in the style of the BBC at the time. There's a fantastic sketch about how the BBC announcer is 'having trouble at home' and can't announce very well, and has another announcer and then *his wife* come in and help him through it, and then congratulate him... as the actual BBC Newscaster appeared on the television to read the 'headlines' silently.		Monty Python requires a lot of context to properly appreciate, especially so many years after all the pop cultural references and groundbreaking humour have ceased to be pop culture and groundbreaking, respectively. It's a similar problem that plagued Seinfeld; it's become so common now that most of the things that they *invented* seem well, cliche to those who have grown up experiencing it all from a dozen different sources.		**Edit:** Reading this, I realise how pretentious it sounds. I wasn't trying to say "You just don't understand it \*sniff*," more just if you only watch the most famous sketches, it's hard to get a true picture of what Monty Python was and why they were so important to the evolution of TV comedy.

I mean, Holy Grail and Life of Brian are pretty good. And pretty much everything Terry Gilliam made after Python is great.Definitely. The movies were what you got when the Pythons put their heads together and actually worked towards a coherent whole. From what I've gathered in interviews, much of the show's sketches were split between the six of them in two-man teams, hence the wildly differing tones from one sketch to the next.		if you like the movies, may I suggest a few of the longer sketches:		Science Fiction Sketch.		Mister Neutron (which was a whole-episode sketch)		The Cycling Tour (another full episode)		and just because it's one of my absolute favourites, and an actual satire of a contemporary film maker: Sam Peckinpah's *Salad Days*
