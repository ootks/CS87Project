The fuck does this actually mean? What is a "dog year"? I've heard this thrown around alot but I've never actually heard anyone explain it further that "1 human year is 7 dog years".A dog lives around 10 years on average, and a human lives about 70 years on average. 	107=70, thus a normal dog lives about 1/7 the length of a human. Witch you could reinterpret as dogs aging 70% faster than a human, witch means that they age 7 years for every normal year.
