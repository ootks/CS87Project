Kitten Lawyersedit: [How to make your representatives listen](http://www.attn.com/stories/14696/how-make-your-representatives-listen)		Speaking of The Animal Legal Defense Fund, a related issue is that the [USDA just removed animal welfare reports from it's website](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/02/03/us/politics/ap-us-usda-animal-welfare-records.html).	===			/u/antiqua_lumina has spoken to the impact of the removal of these reports:		> I work at a major animal rights nonprofit. We utilize the shit out of the database for the good of the public and animals that USDA regulates. This decision is a borderline catastrophe for anyone advocating on behalf of federally-regulated animals (puppy mills, laboratories, animal exhibitors, and other animal dealers/breeders).		===		Please help.	===		- [Find your congressperson](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/)		- [Contact your senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/)		Credit /u/antiqua_lumina: 		===		Dear [senator/congressperson]:		I am alarmed to hear that USDA/APHIS has shut down its entire database of Animal Welfare Act records. This database was an important tool for the public to keep an eye on facilities that serially and egregiously violated the Animal Welfare Act. It was also an important way to make sure the USDA was doing a good job.		The USDA said it shut down the database out of privacy concerns. However, the records it uploaded to the database did not contain sensitive information. Additionally, USDA was already redacting certain information (e.g. the name of its inspectors) before uploading to the database. Why couldn't it do the same for whatever other sensitive information appeared on the document?		The result of this action will be to obscure what is really going on at puppy mills, laboratories, and zoos around the country. It will take months or even years for the public to access this data under normal FOIA requests. The USDA's decision benefits nobody except for corporations that want to keep their animal abuse hidden from the public.	I ask your office to please immediately find out why the USDA shut this important database, and to do everything possible to bring the database back online.		Thank you very much for your assistance in this important matter.		Sincerely,		[Your name]		===		===		As /u/signsandwonders has pointed out, it is better to send a unique letter; however, sending a letter template in is certainly better than nothing.
Kitten LawyersDid Charlie make this poster? Kitten lawyers?

I thought toxoplasmosis was only linked to possibly acting more recklessIt makes rats sexually attracted to cats, so that they run up to the cats instead of running away from them, so then the cats eat them and the toxoplasmosis can only breed in the cat's intestines. Who knows what it does to us to facilitate its evil goals. 
No offense to you, but dae lately get aversions when someone says "the best"? Trumpisms ruin the English language for me.That's not a very wholesome thing to say

Seriously, though, if one group could "ruin" an entire language for you, language that is the infinite intelligible permutations of all possible ideas, it's not the group - it's you.
