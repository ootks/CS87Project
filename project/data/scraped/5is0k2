When someone says /r/WholesomeMemes isn't a good subThis sub is the best when it comes to original, encouraging content. Posts that take originally sad or depressing content and add a positive twist tend to rub me the wrong way though. For me, to a mild extent, it feels like those kinds of posts just put a happy facade over someone else's depression, which doesn't fall in line with the spirit of the subreddit. That being said, I still love this sub, and I love the boundless optimism of its community.

What makes us wholesome as humans is our ability to handle the whole range of human emotions appropriately, and asking for help from friends if we're struggling to do that!

We feign interest, we feign understanding when we don't feel it, and we feign civility when what we really want to do is rip people's heads off for driving poorly. But for society to function we all feign civility, especially when we don't feel it. Sure, it's probably not as good as genuine kindness, but I'll take it if the alternative is anger, vitriol, and selfishness like 90% of the rest of reddit...

I don't hate the sub and it's totally cool that you guys are nice and all. I just feel like sometimes its a bit much to the point where it just seems like its fake and insincere, bit cultish tbh. Totally understand you being wary of it. There are a lot of reasons people sub here, and ironic sincerity is certainly one of them. But I think you'll find that the "niceness" for most of us here is just a cover for "kindness."		I get how the whole hyper-positivity thing can be burdensome, or very easily be seen - as you say- "cultish." But really, people come here for all kinds of reasons, but they stay for one reason: it's satisfying.		It's satisfying to tell people they're doing well. It's satisfying to push a person toward their own goals. It's satisfying to look at a picture of a pupper, and agree with everyone that it's a good pupper.		And most importantly, sadness and negativity isn't banned here, we merely ask that it not be the topic of discussion. If you spend enough time in the comments, I think you'll find that many people will jump at the chance to help someone who is having a hard time. This sub isn't devoid of people with issues. On the contrary, it's full of humans who have done their best, and are optimistic enough to offer their happiness and insight to the rest of us.

When I post something positive about someone here, I don't actually know the person or their positive traits, but I'm sure they have good qualities and no harm can come from saying something positive even if I don't actually know anything about the person.
I like to view this sub as being full of people who are actually sad or depressed but are just faking it til they make it, and encouraging each other along the way, and that makes me feel not so sad.Every time you think a positive thought, write a positive message, smile, laugh, walk with a happy gait, or with a skip in your step you influence the millions of neural pathways in your brain and build connections that make these things easier to access and so come easier and more naturally. 		In other words, even if you're faking it you will one day make it. A positive space can also be very therapeutic in a world where depression is almost a meme. Even if people are just being ironic or funny, I think places like this can be an important thing for a lot of people.

You're proving my pointWhat's wrong with a mixture of genuinely friendly posts and a love circlejerk? It's 10 seconds of good vibes between bad news, political turmoil and crippling depression dominating the front page :)
You're proving my pointAlthough I disagree with your point, it's a pleasure watching you prove it here on this internet forum. 
You're proving my pointIsn't circlejerking the whole point of this sub?
It will take the truthfulness out of it, which is kind of unsettling. To be polite and nice ironically? It weirds me out. Granted, you can't ever know for certain on a messageboard like this, but it's going to feel like something out of uncanny valleyWe are what we pretend to be. Even if someone ironically acts happy and positive, what influence does that have? I'd argue that it'd still brighten other people's days--including the pretender's. It's like when you smile when you're sad. It actually makes you happier, even if it's not a genuine smile.
What makes you disagree with me?Look at pretty much every other sub on reddit: they're all circlejerks of some kind. That's how reddit works. But whereas other subs are pure cynicism, anger, hatred, and general negativity, this place is like a breath of fresh air, as long as you leave your cynicism at the door. Let yourself be a little naive, and don't worry about whether everyone is 100% sincere. Not everyone on /r/meirl is suicidal, and god knows everyone on blackpeopletwitter is actually a white teenager; but as long as everyone shares in the common delusion, who cares? What's the harm in letting everyone believe for just a minute that the world we wanted to see everywhere as a kid is just as real as we always hoped? What's so bad about being good for no reason?
I honestly thought this sub was tongue in cheek It isn't ?
reportedWell if you find this fun I guess that's okay :)
Am Canadian. This place is even nicer than Canada it seems!		Or at least pretty close! deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6750

Marshmellows are never an inconvenience. Unless you make them yourself, which I don't. I'll just grab some for you from the bag. And I'll throw in some mini ones as well, from the other bag. There you go!Huh never thought about making my own marshmallows. I think I'll give it a try
Here, have some gold.thanks for the gold kind stranger!
What's wrong with a mixture of genuinely friendly posts and a love circlejerk? It's 10 seconds of good vibes between bad news, political turmoil and crippling depression dominating the front page :)Exactly! This place is mind bleach from the chaotic front page.
Isn't circlejerking the whole point of this sub?I actually see it as genuine
We are what we pretend to be. Even if someone ironically acts happy and positive, what influence does that have? I'd argue that it'd still brighten other people's days--including the pretender's. It's like when you smile when you're sad. It actually makes you happier, even if it's not a genuine smile.Eh idk about that, fake niceties and politeness can lead some people to have issues. I personally find it distasteful. Thankfully I don't seem to see any of that around this sub, but I see why the OP might be concerned. 
Look at pretty much every other sub on reddit: they're all circlejerks of some kind. That's how reddit works. But whereas other subs are pure cynicism, anger, hatred, and general negativity, this place is like a breath of fresh air, as long as you leave your cynicism at the door. Let yourself be a little naive, and don't worry about whether everyone is 100% sincere. Not everyone on /r/meirl is suicidal, and god knows everyone on blackpeopletwitter is actually a white teenager; but as long as everyone shares in the common delusion, who cares? What's the harm in letting everyone believe for just a minute that the world we wanted to see everywhere as a kid is just as real as we always hoped? What's so bad about being good for no reason?fuck i love you so much

It isn't ?[deleted]
It isn't ?Look at /r/MURICA. That place isn't entirely made up of people who are fanatically devoted to the USA and totally drunk, but there's a sincere amount of patriotism there. Just because people are being purposely sappy here, why does that mean that in reality they're just being spiteful? Can't it mean people are just playing at being a little nicer? And what's so bad about that?

thanks for the gold kind stranger!I second this. 
[removed]I'll just be happy in contributing and seeing where the journey goes as far as this sub is concerned.

fuck i love you so muchAnd I love you random citizen!
Honestly this sub tends to be a circle jerk of kindness but it is just so relieving having a bastion of niceness on the internet. So I keep having to come back.It is a circlejerk of kindness. But everywhere else on Reddit is so depressing and cynical that we kind of need it for balance.

So I keep having to come back.I like it because it kind of highlights what niceness is. Gives something to compare against. Not that I strive to be this level of kind in real life. 
I honestly can't tell if I'm being trolled or notYou aren't. This place is the last bastion of kindness on Reddit. It's actually really refreshing to let your guard down and just be nice :)
That's actually a really incredible way to think about it. Thank you very much for that.[deleted]
I like the way you think. Put a smile on your face, and others will ask where you got it :)
It is a circlejerk of kindness. But everywhere else on Reddit is so depressing and cynical that we kind of need it for balance.This, exactly. I'd been drowning in the hate that's seeping throught not just reddit but the internet in general, and I didn't realize how much it was bothering me until I saw this sub and felt the sadness melting away.
