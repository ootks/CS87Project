Chaotic Good BoyMy next door neighbors are a very sweet retired couple and foster dogs. They are some of the biggest hearted folks I know and love *love* dogs, but the only dog that is their own is this big lump of a black lab named Stevie that is a failed seeing eye dog. He couldn't pass the portion of his test where he had treats out but had to ignore them and follow the commands. Stevie is sweet as a damn pie and God knows that dog is itching to help you all day long, but that boy will drop your shit in a second for a cheese cube.		Edit: a loose cannon apostrophe, yikes!
Chaotic Good BoyI've only just opened reddit but this post is going to make me laugh all day, I can tell. Fuckin dogs, man. They're so ridiculous in all the best ways.
Chaotic Good Boymy sister uses a wheelchair so they tried to train a dog to help her, but he would just steal the socks off her feet whenever he wanted haha he was still a good pet tho
Chaotic Good BoyMaybe she needs to get a couple more gym badges and then the dog will listen.
Chaotic Good BoyI've got a friend who's got a service dog.  He is the *best* dog.  He gets to be a 'normal dog' whenever his guy is just holding the leash and not the harness and man does he make the most of it.  Nuzzling everyone hello and lolling around on the ground waiting to be petted and just loving life.  Then back to work keeping his human safe!  
Chaotic Good BoyOh you silly doggo
Chaotic Good BoyMy lab learned to open doors so I trained her to knock and if nobody answers shes not allowed to come in. Fixed the problem for the most part, unless someone unknown comes knocking, she opens the front door and barks at the entrance and scares the shit out of mailman or whoever is paying a visit.
Chaotic Good BoyOh man, my service dog started his 'career' as a mobility support/special skills dog. He does the same sort of things- turns on and off lights, takes clothes out of the dyer into a laundry basket, getting pants out or a shirt out of different shelves, open and closes doors, helps with mobility, etc. 		He's wonderful 99% of the time, very serious all the time, hard working but he can occasionally hold a grudge- same way a a guide dog occasionally gets annoyed and runs their handler into a doorway. Then it's chaos! Dishes taken out of the dishwasher and left wherever instead of on the counter, every light turned on, laundry strewn about. I can guilt him into cleaning it up after his temper tantrum but he gets his point across. Usually it happens if I accidentally run over his paw with my grocery cart out shopping. He wont be pissy with his working harness on out in public but soon as we get home and he gets his working gear taken off then the temper tantrum starts. 
Chaotic Good BoyThat lady's neighbors must have thought she lived in a haunted house. "The lights turn on and off, over and over, at completely random times. The door will just open up by itself. I've seen it. Her dog was there, inside, but she wasn't home. Crazy." Edit: the dog forgot a word. So bad at taking dictation.
Chaotic Good BoyWhat would a chaotic evil doggo be like?
Chaotic Good BoyI had a dog who would listen to every word I said, but good luck to my older siblings and parents. He would also escape the ski house, run onto the slopes, and take gloves off skiers WHO WERE STILL BOOKING IT DOWN A BLACK DIAMOND. He knew not to eat our gloves.
Chaotic Good BoyHahaha.  I keep seeing this sub in /r/all and it makes me happy, especially contrasted with all the political hullabaloo, so I subbed :)
Chaotic Good BoyMy doggo is a failed police dog. He was supposed to attack the criminals. But he would bite them over and over again instead of holding on. 		He's a super good boy and loves people and dogs but he's a very loyal and protective breed so he looks scary at the door. But he's really a big idiot who likes having his paws held. 
Chaotic Good BoyImagine if there was a Baldur's Gate/Neverwinter Nights style RPG but everything was puppers. That would be great. (Insert fetch quest joke here)
Chaotic Good BoyWe had one of these. She was an Irish Wolfhound mix who was almost 3 feet tall at the shoulder.Shean would go through drawers, leave the fridge open and got out of the yard all the time. She was a very sweet dog. When my daughter went to school she would sneak into her bedroom and steal one of the dolls always the same doll, off the bed and lay down with it on her bed in the living room. Then, before my daughter got home from school she would take the doll and put it back where she got it.
Chaotic Good BoyAre failed service dogs common? 
Chaotic Good BoyD'awwwh
Chaotic Good BoyPunchline in the title
Chaotic Good BoyHey OP, great post! One small suggestion for next time, if you don't put the punchline in the title that gives us the chance to experience it for ourselves!
Chaotic Good BoyOh man. My wife and I are getting ready to adopt a failed service dog. This might be our life soon. 
Chaotic Good BoyWelcome to life as a cat owner. ;)

Edit: a loose cannon apostrophe, yikes!My next door neighbor fosters seeing eye dogs.  Every year he gets a new black lab.  It stays with him for a year and then they send it to upstate NY where it gets more training and then gets assigned to a person who needs a dog.   		He has us pet sit them when he's out of town and the dogs are amazing  -- best mannered pets ever.  It's just like that Simpsons episode where they get Laddie.		He lets them run around outside without a leash sometimes (which he's not allowed to do) and one time the dog ran to the next street over, and someone picked it up and called the number on the tag (the org that owns the dog).		He got in big trouble with the seeing eye dog organization and they threatened to have him never foster again.   		He was telling me the story about getting in trouble and he said, '**they're just upset because these are $30,000 dogs**'.  I was blown away by that.

Are failed service dogs common? yes, but they always get adopted since they are popular breeds and well trained.
Are failed service dogs common? I raised a Seeing Eye puppy. They look for volunteers to raise their puppies from 2-12 months old. It seemed like the failure rate is very high. There was one foster family in the program who was on their fourth puppy, and all of the previous three had failed. Mine did too! The bar is very high for any dog that will be responsible for the safety of a human.		The foster parents get first dibs though. So of course we kept ours. She came back from her training with excellent manners, but the Seeing Eye didn't share with us what they had taught her. If she learned any specialized service dog skills, we'll never know... She didn't do anything out of the ordinary. She was a great dog though.
Punchline in the titleit's a D&D reference, calmate amigo
To be fair id much rather a doggo with a mind of his own than a service dog that does exactly as theyre told		A little chaos is expected from all my animalsDifferent purposes i guess, if it's a service dog it probably should do as told.
To be fair id much rather a doggo with a mind of his own than a service dog that does exactly as theyre told		A little chaos is expected from all my animalsPretty easy to say when you aren't blind, lol. Come on.
To be fair id much rather a doggo with a mind of his own than a service dog that does exactly as theyre told		A little chaos is expected from all my animalsI agree with you, then I would realize the error in my ways when I come home to see my freezer has been open for 8 hours and the doggo is just sitting there.
the fact that he's acting selfishly means it'd be evil.  I'm kind of torn on the chaotic or lawful aspect, since he adhered to the orders given down to him to learn the skills, yet is currently disobeying his masters in order to do as he wishes...		So probably neutral evil would be a more accurate description, imo.Eh, evil requires maliciousness, good requires altruism. I'd say chaotic or true neutral. Doing what he wants, when he wants, without consideration of "the rules" would seem to indicate chaotic.		That said, all puppers are good, so chaotic good it is!
That actually sounds like an issue...I mean obviously dogs are amazing but if you legitimately are disabled and your service dog doesn't listen that would suckThat's how the friend got the dog silly. The failed ones get adopted out to families that don't need service dogs. 
I knew a dog like this! My teacher was doing the pre-service training with him the first year and basically everyone knew he'd fail. Way too food motivated. So a bunch of families went on the waitlist for him, and one got him and ended up making him a therapy dog for kids with special needs, which was the perfect job for him.  	He's a giant calm doof, he just didn't have the focus to lead a blind person.This was what our failed seeing eye dog did! He was calm and sweet and friendly but every time he saw a squirrel he flipped shit which is simply not ideal for a blind person being led by a hundred pound newfoundland.	Now he's a "companion animal" for a teenage boy with autism and just gets to romp around and receive endless belly rubs

How did you teach the dog to knock?! And how does he do aforementioned knocking?Every time when she opened a door without permission I told her bad dog, the knocking came naturally after that. She bumps her head to the door and waits, if you don't open the door she starts bumping it even more and if you don't open she gives up. 
WHAT? I would like to subscribe to your newsletter- this was insane to read.  This is[ Schalke](http://i.imgur.com/3gaBU3r.jpg)! And here [he is with his sister.](http://i.imgur.com/Ck2tkOe.jpg)		I've had him as my service dog for 6 1/2 years now and he's literally saved my life twice. He even went through a bad roll over car accident with my husband and I, travelling in the ambulance with me to the emergency room(he is registered as "do not separate from handler" type of service dog with that kind of numbered badge and people are very good about respecting that) before being taken by my father in law to be treated at a nearby vet. 		He's an amazing dog. Not much for fun at all, and he's always on the look out for anyone who might fall down and need help. His one time he relaxes is he loves to retrieve orange hockey balls- though even that is serious business.		He's amazing, but yeah he can have a real attitude sometimes. Especially if he decides something is dangerous and I try and convince him it's not. His mission is to not let me get hurt and he's always on the job whether I want him to be or not! Oh and he's never been wrong when he alerts a seizure is coming. I sometimes think "I feel fine no way I'm going to seize" but he's never been wrong. He tells me and I sit on the floor or lay on my bed and get into a safe position- then he lays across me to prevent me trying to get up and falling. Especially post seizure when I was trying to get up and falling not realising I was out of it. 		Good ol' Schalke. He loves his marro-bones treats and he earns them.

Aww, that's so cute.

He'll be sitting right next to me on the bed, and as soon as the lights go out, he'll run out to the living room and start howling. 		And I'll be laying in bed going "Dude, I'm right here. I didn't go anywhere. I'm right where you left me."		Then he runs back and jumps on the bed like "Oh, thank god. I thought I'd lost you."
Aww, that's so cute. One of my cats was a bit dim so she did a similar thing...by yowling at max volume in the living room at 3AM. >__> but we loved her anyway lolMy cat used to do that when we first had him.  I get wicked cranky when my sleep is disturbed, so I started putting him in the basement with the door closed whenever he made noise at night.   		 It didn't take him long to learn that if he runs around and yowls when we're sleeping, he loses the ability to look out the windows, and can't come sleep with his people when he gets bored with that.  Now he spends most nights curled up next to my face, and if he needs to go prowl, he's quiet and sneaky about it.

Another way that is not well known, but super vital, is a courtroom support dog. You have to be a really tough person though. Basically victims are comforted by your dog while they testify, and you have to be there and hear it all. I would never be able to do it, but there is a serious need. I didn't even know that was a thing! Awesome. Thank you!
It's the blonde leading the blonde.I just imagined a big goofy yellow lab calmly explaining things to a blonde woman through gestures and whines. What a world.
How can someone get a failed service dog? Is there a club or a website? Well for my club they first get offered to the raisers. If the raisers don't want to keep the dog then the raiser gets the right to offer the dog to a friend or family member. If they don't have anyone interested then they adopt them out of our local campus.		I don't want to say which club specifically that I'm in but just google "seeing eye dog's California" and you'll see a couple.
Haha, ya got me, fixed it :)You dont dare fixing it without editing your post or my comment will not look wholesome.
My cat does that as soon as I turn off the lights at bed time. He'll be sitting right next to me on the bed, and as soon as the lights go out, he'll run out to the living room and start howling. 		And I'll be laying in bed going "Dude, I'm right here. I didn't go anywhere. I'm right where you left me."		Then he runs back and jumps on the bed like "Oh, thank god. I thought I'd lost you."LOL that reminded me of this one time on the kitten foster livestream I watch. The kittens (a few weeks old, old enough to have control over their legs and run without falling down) had all been asleep in a pile, but slowly the pile shifted toward mom on the other side of the area...except for one kitten.		That one kitten wakes up facing away from everyone else. He can tell there's no one near him but he doesn't turn around! So he starts sadly mewing/meeping for his family, thinking he's been abandoned in his sleep.		Mama wakes up with a sleepy grumpy face, and trill-meows at him, like "we're still here, come to the pile'. He turns around, sees everyone, and trots over to snuggle up into the pile. It was the cutest, silliest thing I've seen in a while. I'll try to see if there's a clip of it on the channel's youtube and I'll edit this post when I find it.		EDIT: [It's not quite how I remembered it, but I saw it happen live so it's been a few years.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdKZJSZebLs) It's also happened more than once, with many litters, so I might have just fused all of them together in my head lol.
Yeah,  but it follows the meme regulations for /r/raredoggosOh. I don't follow that sub. I'm actually more of a cat person!

I love hearing your stories about Schalke! Please tell more! What breed is he?He's a Springer Spaniel x [L'Epagneul Francais](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89pagneul_fran%C3%A7ais). So one spaniel, assorted. 		[Here he is a puppy stuck in a table.](http://i.imgur.com/347Fzic.jpg) 		I do love talking about him. He's amazing because he's my safety net, after brain damage I went from wheel chair to walker to using him as mobility support and can walk now. We even trained for a 5 km race after I had been through rehab. I have serious problems again but he's still my walking support and keeping me from having to use a wheelchair except rarely. That's what that heavy duty harness he wears is for- support. Though he has a mixed guide + mobility harness system because I lost vision after that brain damage and have continued losing vision since. 			He went through a very bad accident when he was younger- his foot was caught in a foot trap set at a local offleash hiking trail. When the snares and foot traps were set the municipality was supposed to put up warnings for people to keep dogs out for the duration of catching the coyote but, well, they didn't(sadly, someone's border collie was snared). I threw him the ball during his off duty walk and he went to retrieve it and that's when his foot was partially severed. If you can picture a leg hold trap snapping shut he managed to yank his foot almost free, just the bottom was cut. So he came limping back and blood was everywhere. My father had to carry him to his SUV gushing blood and drive him to the vet as an emergency. We had two his toes that were re-attached, he had to have skin grafts on the bottom pad, and he lost two ligaments that couldn't be found up inside his leg where they were cut through. It was months and months and months of vet visits every two days for bandage changes and  treatment. It was terrifying because with a limp he could stay working but if the foot was amputated he was required to retire. For three months it looked like he was going to loose the leg- I was heart broken. The waiting list for special skills dogs is very, very long and they have to be trained specifically for you and your own disabilities. I admit that I was also attached to the idiot- he saved my life when I blacked out and fell into an icy ditch at -17 weather! It was night and no one would have found me before I went into hypothermia if he had not run back to the nearest houses then back to me and back to houses and back to me until someone finally followed him and called 911. We had bonded intensely- but I can't take care of a dog who was not my service dog. I couldn't have kept him and a new service dog. I need a service dog. I have 0 independence without one. It's embarrassing but I can't even go to the bathroom alone without his help to sit and stand off the toilet.		Luckily by month 4 we started seeing him healing up, he also perked up emotionally. By the end of six months we knew his leg was safe! BUT he has what I call his "goofy toes"- these are the two severed and reattached toes that have no ligament and missing some bone and cannot move. They just kinda flop there being silly on his paw. 		He does have a limp, but you can't always see it. 		The most amazing thing of all is that remember how I said he took his ball retrieving seriously? When he was injured he **STILL BROUGHT BACK THE BALL**! With part of his foot cut off by a leg hold trap! He tried to run back and stumbled and tried again, stumbled again, then literally elbow crawled his way back, leaving a rivulet of blood, and delivered the ball to my tennis racquet! (I can't bend down to pick up a ball and can't see well to catch it or move my arms well to throw it so I use an over sized tennis racquet. I hold it out flat and he returns the ball by running back to me and placing the ball on the flat racquet face. When I hear and feel it hit the racquet I know I have it back and can 'toss' it for him again).		It's part of who he is. He finishes the job no matter what! 	[Here is his during a his healing stage with a splint and bandage.](http://i.imgur.com/gQHUf6G.jpg)			--	 	One time when someone ran a red light while we were crossing he pulled me back out of danger. He's been taught a lot of rules about dealing with cars- he will not let me pass behind a car with it's back up lights on, and he literally looks right and left before crossing a street. In this case he was listening for the crossing beep at the zebra crossing but someone ran the red light! He saw it coming and forced me back into safety even though it meant he got knicked by the car and knocked off his feet and backwards. He was fine except for a bruised shoulder where he was pushed into the curb when he fell, but it was a hard enough hit to yank his harness out my of hand! He got up and first thing he did was his 'leash' command, which is positioning himself so the handle touches my fingers/palm and I can find him even when I have no vision. (if on a regular leash he picks the leash up in his mouth and pushes that against my hand). People stopped to check on us and call for help and he got checked out to be sure no broken leg since he was favoring the shoulder.		He got be on the news and was on a poster about furry heroes on an online service dog awareness week a website did, which was awesome! 		Oh but he has some bad things about him- he hates children. HATES them. He'll brace them if they start to fall off their bike but otherwise he finds they run and fall too much for his liking and he'll bark to if they are being unsafe near him. When working(in his harness) if they try and touch him he just freezes and cringes, or moves away from the touch. Off duty he will avoid children anyway he can. He also doesn't understand how to speak dog very well. Special Skills dogs have intense training and they start young. He missed a lot of early socialisation and they're recommended just as handler you keep them away from other dogs on walks or playing. He didn't know how to play any dog games really, like tug of war until I moved in with my fiance who got a little yellow Lab puppy. She taught him a lot about how to be a dog. He discovered how to play and I honestly think it was good for him to learn how to be a little bit less obsessively focus on me.		He's not fond of other dogs, not nasty but not really nice. He does seem to have genuinely warmed up to his sister, though.		And he has the worst farts in the universe. Like the spawn of Nurgle live in his ass. It makes my eyes water. Lab has normal smelly dog farts and they are awful but Schalke's butt is like a portal into another very, very gross stinky dimension. It's a black hole of ultra dense uber stank destroying all around it.

That's the one I watch the most often; right now it's kittens from over Christmas and they're named after Santa's reindeer. The litters always have themed names.		This one happens to have a facebook page (and most of their "graduates" get facebook pages too) as well, by the same name. :)
