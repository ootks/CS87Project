Zoom in on his noseThis reminds me of getting textbooks lent to us in high school. There would always be 'turn to page 43' 'turn to page 86' etc etc.		On the final page it would say 'You are a a really great person' or 'have a wonderful day'.		Obviously it was actually something the complete opposite of that, but I chose to keep in line with the theme of the sub.

Lmao you got me with the paw			Edit: I've never seen this amount of karma. Thank you r/wholesomememesGuys, guys, I got the correct paw on the first try! I usually fall for these things too, so this may be my proudest moment yet.		I'd like to thank my family for raising me okay, the previous bamboozle puzzles for teaching me the hard way. Also, to the OP without whom this would never be possible. And I'd like to wish everyone no more bamboozlement (unless they want it)!

Is this the new meme?Interactive memes.
Is this the new meme?These memes have been around forever but they usually were not very wholesome and ended with "The Game."
Is this the new meme?I very much hope it does become one. Because we need to tell everyone they are beautiful and they would be a good doggo if they were a doggo.
I'm hungover as fuck and I can't sleep (it's 5:20)... but this photo made me realise I can achieve my dreams today and maybe even get treats.You can do anything you want to.

They're wild goose chases for meaningless words. This one says if I was a dog I'd be a good boy - stating I followed commands well. That's not a compliment that's rather like what a controlling person would say!Even dogs that aren't well trained are good boys
If anyone wants bamboozlement they should zoom in again and take a look at the text on his whiskers! You have to zoom real good though. Oh you got me!! Guess I was made for being bamboozled
