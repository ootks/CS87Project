Don't care who you are, let's party!!It really just makes me all sorts of happy when younger people are aware that the older generations were once young, once vain, or shallow, or ignorant, but also carefree, inexperienced, students... just "young." And we remember how life felt when life was this endless landscape of vast opportunity and adventures not yet taken, when getting out or hooking up was our primary goal to have "fun", or the ease of getting enough of a group together to really enjoy a fun movie at home or play a board game or party game, and being able to stay over and get a little tipsy. Looking good, feeling good.		And what makes me even happier is the older generation here isn't cynical, or angry, or so tired of everything we all go through in our lives. Upon seeing these fun-having, young people, the first thought in her head isn't jealousy, it isn't eye-rolling, it isn't tutting them for dressing in sexy outfits, for taking selfies, for being loud.... the first thought in her head is, "I remember those times, those girls are going to have a great time, get in silly fights with their friends that feel like the end of the world, sleep with people they regret, anything can happen....and I hope those girls look back on tonight as fondly as I look back on all that nights of fun and hijinks.... that built the life I have lived."		This post is truly wholesome when you think of the 99.99% of other possible interactions in which this exact scenario could possibly end.		Great job OP! Thanks for sharing! I love you, have a hug!

Don't care who you are, let's party!!Probably going to be buried but want to share my relevant story. While I was studying in Spain we used to hang out after class in a nearby bar across the street that had one pool table. Helped kill time and we enjoyed a playful banter by making fun of each other skills (pretty decent players but nothing exceptional).		One day a very old guy comes and watches us play. And the etiquette is to place two quarters (the euro equivalent) to show you got the table for next game. So this dude places his coins and we were planning to take the game after his. When his turn came we learned that he was by himself and just wanted to join one of our teams. Obviously we agreed, but held back our teases as we didn't want to make him feel bad.		It didn't take long for us to figure out that he was great at this game and later learned he used to be a professional player when he was younger. He became part of our group consistently after that and also became the biggest troll when he was losing. 		Totally changed my perspective on how to interact with older people. Many can totally act like us as they were us once. Pepe, I hope you are still trolling the students at Bo Finn.

Don't care who you are, let's party!!This makes me so ridiculously happy...like, don't even have words. I hope when I'm older and feel like my partying days are over someone makes me feel like part of something, reminds me I'm more than just my age and the greys in my hair. And I hope the next time I'm out partying with my friends that an older person has the kindness to say something friendly and allows us to include them.

Don't care who you are, let's party!!Drunk girls in the restroom are the nicest people ever. On my 21st birthday I was waiting for a stall and group of 4 girls saw my birthday sash and got fucking psyched. They handed me a mini bottle of Fireball out of nowhere and cheered for me to chug it, wished me a happy birthday, and left. It was pretty rad.

Don't care who you are, let's party!!OLD PEOPLE BEING HAPPY MAKES ME CRY ON THE SPOT AAAAAHHHHH. Idk what it is man. It's just (in America) society seems to stop giving a shit about people once they hit a certain age, just ship them off to homes where they could easily experience elder abuse and also catch a ton of stds (no one talks to the elderly about using protection ) and then some never even get visits and it breaks my heart. They have to deal with so much physically, emotionally, and mentally so seeing people going out of their way to be kind makes me overwhelmed with emotion. This sub makes me cry so much ahaha the elderly deserve to party and have fun just as much as the rest of us (if not more)

Don't care who you are, let's party!!Okay this place is so adorable! Whoever is out there reading this, I wish y'all the best. 
Don't care who you are, let's party!!"I remember when my friends and I would get dressed up for a night on the town. We'd do our hair, wear low-cut shirts, show our ankles. Betty Sue was the real pretty one, so she was on boy patrol. She'd real them in, let them fawn over her and buy her drinks...Now, we always stayed near to Betty Sue while she was fishing, because it was our job to sneak up when the boy was lost in her eyes and to spike his drink. Within an hour he was slurring and stumbling like a regular ole tippler. So we'd lead him to Laura's house, she had her own place. Take him upstairs, push him back on the bed, tie his limbs to the posts. Then Mary Anne, she'd pull out this long, crooked, ceremonial dagger made of pure obsidian. She'd plunge it into the boy's chest and she'd draw it all the way down to his navel. One of us would stuff and hold socks in his mouth, to mute any screaming. When Mary was done, we'd each reach in and grab an organ, and we'd take those to her backyard, nice and secluded, where we burnt the organs as offerings to Satan. Afterwards, with blood on our hands, we'd start taking off each others clothes, touching and kissing each other all over like school girls do. I miss those days...So, do you girls like to party or what?"

It really just makes me all sorts of happy when younger people are aware that the older generations were once young, once vain, or shallow, or ignorant, but also carefree, inexperienced, students... just "young." And we remember how life felt when life was this endless landscape of vast opportunity and adventures not yet taken, when getting out or hooking up was our primary goal to have "fun", or the ease of getting enough of a group together to really enjoy a fun movie at home or play a board game or party game, and being able to stay over and get a little tipsy. Looking good, feeling good.		And what makes me even happier is the older generation here isn't cynical, or angry, or so tired of everything we all go through in our lives. Upon seeing these fun-having, young people, the first thought in her head isn't jealousy, it isn't eye-rolling, it isn't tutting them for dressing in sexy outfits, for taking selfies, for being loud.... the first thought in her head is, "I remember those times, those girls are going to have a great time, get in silly fights with their friends that feel like the end of the world, sleep with people they regret, anything can happen....and I hope those girls look back on tonight as fondly as I look back on all that nights of fun and hijinks.... that built the life I have lived."

Probably going to be buried but want to share my relevant story. While I was studying in Spain we used to hang out after class in a nearby bar across the street that had one pool table.

And the etiquette is to place two quarters (the euro equivalent) to show you got the table for next game. So this dude places his coins and we were planning to take the game after his.

I bet a lot of them are drug-fueled too.If by "drug-fueled" you mean Coca-cola, cotton candy, milk and chocolate-chip cookies then I bet she does.

EDIT: For those of you who disagree, I don't think you know what older people really look like. She's defiitely older than 70.
I bet a lot of them are drug-fueled too.Sounds amazing! 
wew i'm missing out on that because of my mental health yee-hawWhat /u/whilelminTherapy describes is a really beautiful and positive way to view different periods of your life, but do not fall into the trap of thinking that your youth *will* be the best years of your life and it's downhill from there. You get to make a choice about where your life goes, and if you make good choices, your life can become richer as you get older. The longer you live, the more skills you can learn, the more places you can visit, the deeper the friendships you can develop, and the greater understanding of the world and its people you can gain. There's no age limit on valuable experiences.

It comes from back in the day when things broke and you would use haywire as a quick fix :)Hmm. We have *baling* wire in the garage, but somehow as a modern semi-urban creature I guess I never made the connection, really. It's pretty strong stuff.

Really? MDMA use is the biggest it's ever been.

Anyone who started in this decade and isn't actually paying attention to their drugs probably hasn't had real Molly.		I'd definitely try MDMA, but I don't think I'll even bother getting a testing kit because I'm so sure that where I am will not have any good shit.		And there's research drugs all over blotters under the guise of LSD too.
