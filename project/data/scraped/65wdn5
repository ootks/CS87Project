Sorry been sitting here for 5 minutes just saying al pacino and alpaca my roommates must think i'm crazy.Well if we're being even-steven, I'd venture to say it's pronounced al-PA-chee-no, with the accented a as it is said in cat. That way the phonetics are with Al Pacino, but the accenting is with alpaca.
