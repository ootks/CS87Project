I don't see how they look cool anymore.

Is it actually clear that it depends on your life decisions, as opposed to genetics or sheer luck?Nope, I don't think it's opposed to. I think it's alongside. I mean, I've never tried being 60, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are someone out there who are just going to age very fast regardless of their choices in life, but it sure as hell won't help if they smoke on top of that. I'm just saying that's when your decisions in life are *really* going to show, I believe. Your genetics show through much earlier. You know, like a 30 year old with a babyface, or a 15 year old who could pass for 22. These differences are always there.
Is it actually clear that it depends on your life decisions, as opposed to genetics or sheer luck?People who drink all their lives compared to those who eat healthy and exercise show clear physical differences at that age.
