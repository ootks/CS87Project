I've got a 2nd interview today. What color sock should I wear?Green. I don't know why but green spreads happiness for me
I've got a 2nd interview today. What color sock should I wear?Studies have shown that the color blue attracts the human eye, hence law enforcement around the world utilizing blue lights. If you want them to know your wearing socks try blue! 
I've got a 2nd interview today. What color sock should I wear?My wife is a corporate controller, and she has a team of accountants that work under her.  They have tons of required compliance meetings, and while they're part of the job, they're very boring and nobody likes them. So for Christmas this year, she bought everyone a pair of these socks. 			https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Novelty-Socks-Meeting-Bullshit/dp/B01I1YJMYQ

Thanks. I'm going to be applying for new jobs soon  and I'm nervous about it, but this helps. I'll remember to get real pooffy. :) As someone who has interviewed hundreds of people, if not thousands, for both entry level and management positions, let me just say that being nervous is allowed.  As long as you're not sweating through your jacket, a little bit of nervousness usually shows that you place a high level of importance on the interview and the job, and it's better than the people who act like they don't care about the interview. 		Protip, if you find yourself fumbling a bit because of your anxiety, acknowledge it to the interviewer.  A quick "I'm sorry, I'm excited about this position, and I'm a bit nervous," shows self-awareness and an ability to admit faults. You can even take a minute to compose yourself if that's what's needed.  Some great employees are bad at interviewing, and most interviewer are fully aware of this. 		Be yourself, don't worry too much, and you'll do great.

Thanks. I'm going to be applying for new jobs soon  and I'm nervous about it, but this helps. I'll remember to get real pooffy. :) I'm searching as well.  If you are seeking a career with an establishment, rather than just a job, be sure to research the company so that you are familiar with some lingo and facts about them.  This shows you have interest.  
Good timing on this post, I have a big job interview in a few hours and I'm super stressed Hey there! 		Last week, I went to an all-day assessment centre for a job and was so nervous and stressed, I cried the day before! However once I was there and got to know my interviewers, I started to relax as the anxiety of the build-up/unknown was over.		Remember that they've invited you in for your interview because they are interested in you, and they want you to succeed! And so do all of us here. We have faith in you. Sending you positive vibes, friend!		Good luck!!

I like Ramses a lot but I don't think he knows me, my name is an Animal Crossing reference.Huh.		Thought that Brewster was an owl.

This makes me really confident about some recent interviews I did. I did a telephone assessment a while ago. I told the lady on the other side it was my first interview and she told me to relax and we'd get through it well.		I was rather nervous, spoke a bit too much and thought I'll just be discarded. Interestingly though, I passed!		So here is hope for you that you'll also pass friend. And I know you will!
And beeping!And sprinkles, because you're worth it!
Just like you :)You're a good person! 
Do you by chance play animal crossing? :3I do, it's probably my favorite Nintendo series.
Huh.		Thought that Brewster was an owl.Nope. He's good friends with Blathers though, who is an owl. That's why (until New Leaf) he was in the museum basement. Even in NL, blathers is the one that suggests you build the roost for him.		He also puts "pigeon milk" into your coffee if you become good enough friends with him. In real life pigeon milk is pigeon puke of some sort, but I guess it tastes sweet.
That sounds like Tom Bombadil.Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;		Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.
What about blue then? :) What about black thigh highs and no pants? 
Because you're worth itWe are all worth sprinkles.
