A comment on a puppy videoI checked with Snopes, it's 100% true.
A comment on a puppy videoThis makes me feel better about calling my current dog the *best dog* when my dear old golden retriever was also, clearly, the best dog.
A comment on a puppy videoMy life has been made so much more joyful by the presence of my dogs. I only hope I can make their too-brief stays on Earth as good as they deserve.
A comment on a puppy videoWell I just asked my dog if she's a good girl and she wagged her whole body and graciously accepted some of my toast.  She clearly is a good girl.		Edit.  She just lost some points for unfortunate elbow placement
A comment on a puppy videoIt's funny because it's true. :D

They're good dogs, Bront!This isn't something you should be ignoring, Scout. 
"Let it be written here that all doggos are created equal, and have the right to life, pats, and good sleeps."  Don't forget treats.
"Let it be written here that all doggos are created equal, and have the right to life, pats, and good sleeps."  Why do we put them in shitty conditions, then?		Sleeping outside in a wooden box, and probably some other things.
[dog logic](http://threewordphrase.com/logic.htm)Haha I thought you were going to link to [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/Vks6Rr9.jpg) when you said "dog logic" (although yours makes more sense given the context)
[dog logic](http://threewordphrase.com/logic.htm)Very sweet comic
I KNEW it	Deep down, inside, we all knew. 
[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QslV86odco) the puppy video, if anyone's interested :-)I've seen this video 100 times at least and it will never be enough. Thanks for sharing!

whosagoodboy.jpgEvery dog!
Mine sucks. She's a good pet. Doesn't chew, bark, pee inside...		But she's a terrible dog...she doesn't play with toys, want to wrestle, go swimming, play with anyone.... chew on toys... have fun.... she's afraid of sticks, doesn't want to learn tricks, doesn't fetch balls. She's afraid of balls actually. 		Does anyone want her?	She's a really good *pet*My dog was like that, did not act like a "normal dog". I think he grew up around kids and cats tbh. Then we adopted another dog. We've had the other dog almost a year now and the first dog acts way more dog-like. You just need another do to show your dog how to dog.

This one time my family adopted a black lab. She was one of the dumbest animals I've ever met. I saved her from drowning in shallow water on two separate occasions. She didn't know how to go down stairs. She would just kinda run down them and would always fall, one time cutting her neck open. She would also try to start shit with my other dogs like stealing their food. My dogs would get the best of her but the next day she'd go for their food again. We ended up giving her to another family. She was not a good dog. Good dog in the wrong home.		My dog doesn't get along with other dogs but she's great in a single dog household.
Why are you so happy brant?He had a good day, which may or may not involve good doggo.
Why are you so happy brant?You had one job
Don't forget treats.That's the third dogmendment
Why do we put them in shitty conditions, then?		Sleeping outside in a wooden box, and probably some other things.My doggos sleep inside tho.

Haha I thought you were going to link to [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/Vks6Rr9.jpg) when you said "dog logic" (although yours makes more sense given the context)I thought you were going to link [this comic](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/q46L4QH)! Dogs are great. 		Edit: words
Thank you, friend. You are the best. No, *you* are the best :-)
Excuse my off topic question,  but isn't renarde similar to vixen in English?  Like a female fox? Yes! I dye my hair in red, that's why I chose this username. And because "HORSESIZEDICK" was already taken, so...
You had one jobAnd they did it was well as they could. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. 
That's the third dogmendment2nd being: *The right to keep and bear the cutest damn smile*
That's the third dogmendmentYou mean... dogma?
My doggos sleep inside tho.My doggo takes up more of the bed than i do
My doggos sleep inside tho.thank you for not being cruel to your doggos.
Because not all people are quite as wholesome as they could be, unfortunately. But a lot of em are, and that's something that I think we forget sometimes. People in general are pretty good folks

And they did it was well as they could. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. ... Can I just give up reality and live in this subreddit?
And they did it was well as they could. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. They're just happy little accidents.

2nd being: *The right to keep and bear the cutest damn smile*o7
You mean... dogma?No silly. Dogtrine.
My doggo takes up more of the bed than i doI have one little doggo that likes to curl up in a ball right on top of me while I sleep and another that lays completely spread out on the foot of the bed. Can confirm, there is more space occupied by dog in my bed than human. 
My doggo takes up more of the bed than i domine too. two med-large doggos on a king sized bed should mean I still have plenty of space, but they sleep on top of me anyway.
And here I was expecting the link to be to [this comic](http://www.threepanelsoul.com/comic/dog-philosophy).They're all the best comics!

... Can I just give up reality and live in this subreddit?You said that as if r/wholesomememes and real life are black and white on the color spectrum, and that they can't mix, when that simply isn't the fact. You can make a conscious decision to be wholesome in your everyday life and while it might not seem like much, you can absolutely make people's days better just by your attitude. So don't give up on life to go entirely to r/wholesomememes, bring r/wholesomememes into your everyday life!
They're just happy little accidents. [We don't make mistakes - we just have happy accidents.](http://imgur.com/VHYjWCQ)
And the 5th one is: Honor thy dogger and pupper6th accept the cate as your bro for he does not know he sins.
They're all the best comics!The question now becomes why isn't there a subreddit specifically for me to look at cute dog comics like these
