Best FriendShit like this makes me sad when I look at my parent's relationship. They've been married for 20+ years but they don't even like each other anymore. I just wish that sometimes they would go out and try to find someone else in their lives.
Best FriendThis is a great goal to have. My wife is my best friend and going on 8 years together our relationship is only getting better. It can happen to you too!
Best FriendMy mother and father were always this way.		A couple years ago, my sister, father, mother and I all got drunk one night, and my dad went into a long monologue about how much he loved our mother. Everyone was teary eyed and it was a really fun night.		Sorry to be a downer, but it was only a few short months later that we discovered he was cheating on our mother.

Feels good man :')		
Best FriendWell that's adorable! And I love that they're drinking wine at 7:30 
Best FriendMy wife doesn't like it when I call her friend, because "she doesn't sleep with her friends." I've compromised on girlfriend.
Best FriendMy husband and I play Jeopardy every night and make a point to cheer when one of us gets one right. 		I love us. 
Best FriendA couple times during our relationship, my boyfriend was asked to attend weddings without me, which doesn't bother me because a) I get to hang around the house all day bra-less and b) I will get drunk texted and drunk called throughout the night with messages of him saying I'm his best friend. 		That guy wins.

Best FriendI love hanging out with my wife.  I ask her every weekend if she'll marry me.  She always reminds me that she already did.
Best FriendJust came out of this and it's hard. But I know that I can get through it. At the moment I'm just scared I won't find that anywhere else.
Best FriendMy wife and I have had children almost the entire 4 years we have been married. Money has been a struggle, but we are finally getting ahead. Last night I rearranged the bedroom and put a TV in it for the first time since we got married. We just watched movies. It was like being on vacation.
Best FriendIf you'll excuse me, I need to cry for a while.

Shit like this makes me sad when I look at my parent's relationship. They've been married for 20+ years but they don't even like each other anymore. I just wish that sometimes they would go out and try to find someone else in their lives.My best buddy's parents are just like that. Dad just hangs out in the basement and smokes and drinks and mom sits upstairs playing solitaire and watching TV. They don't eat together, don't talk and go days at a time without seeing each other.		He hates holidays because everything is so fake and forced and he's constantly back and forth between spending time with one or the other.		I think it has to do with the fact that when they were dropping him off to college he found out his dad wasn't his biological father and then later discovered his dad had a second family. 		They just played make believe for the first 18 years of his life but have secretly always hated him. Nobody has told his brother anything yet either which is pretty messed up. 		I'm of the opinion these situations would be better if people just knew when to go their separate ways.
This is a great goal to have. My wife is my best friend and going on 8 years together our relationship is only getting better. It can happen to you too!My husband and I are coming up on our 8 year wedding anniversary and yep. He's my best friend :) It's great!

Why do people call it wine drunk if it's the same thing as being beer drunk or etcIt's a different type of drunk. Like how Tequila makes ppl think they're the best dancer in the world, or Rum makes ppl want to fight (etc) 	Wine drunk is usually a very mellow happy drunk. It's my personal favorite:)
Why do people call it wine drunk if it's the same thing as being beer drunk or etcBecause it is NOT the same as beer drunk.
Drunk is drunk. There's no such thing as wine drunk or whiskey drunk, it's all your head. The alcohol affects you the exact same way. Sorry to be nit picky but it's upsetting that we live in a supposedly educated society yet this nonsense still persists.its upsetting that people experience something, and for some reason it makes you angry, and you have to tell them they are wrong in an aggressive manner, even though ultimately, it doesn't fucking matter either way and makes no difference to anyone or anything, if people are convinced wine drunk is different to beer drunk.		not to mention there are plausible explanations for the difference. wine could have chemicals besides alcohol that cheer you up slightly, kind of like cacoa does. beer could not have those chemicals, and thus feel different. i tend to get sluggish and tired long before i get drunk on beer, which is probably the excess of carbs, which doesn't happen with wine, cause wine is stronger, and you get drunk quicker and ingest less unnecessary carbs. its entirely fucking plausible to feel different when the beverages have different levels of macro nutrients and possibly other chemicals which might affect mood, so cheer the fuck up and have some wine fucko.
I've always disliked it when people attribute their "significant other " as being their "Best Friend". You're not friends, you're lovers! which is so much more IMO. 		If you're calling your spouse your best friend, you probably don't have a best friend.The idea is that your SO is friend first before all else, that they're someone you enjoy spending your time with regardless of sex. Not all best friends are lovers, but all lovers are [ideally] best friends.

Love means a lot of things to different people, but to me, once you've stripped out everything else, the very last thing thats left is respect. All of the things that made you want to be with your partner can disappear overtime but what should be left is that level of respect that they were someone you cared about at one time.		My father has told us he doesn't see anything wrong with what he did because he "fell out of love" with our mom. I think if you can do that to someone you truly felt that you loved at one time, than maybe it wasn't love that you were feeling afterall.

This gives me hope.I've been single and lost for a very, very long time, so much so that I got used to it.	It came to the point that I'm only interested in making friends with the opposite sex. If I'm nice to someone, it's because I want to.		I went to a nye party with one of my good friend, he ask me advices on how to talk to girls, I said: do like this, so I got up, scanned the dance floor and talked to the prettiest girl there, and ask her nicely if we could talk, tell her that my friend is really shy with girls and if it would be okay if I introduced her and maybe he can practice talking to a stranger. She was nice enough to oblige me and they talk for a bit. 		They talked for a good 20 minutes, they seemed to get along well so I let them be, be friend says he wasn't interested(I know hes just being too shy), so I keep introducing her to guys the week after, later on, she offers to give me a ride home, but as we got in her car, it didn't start. She got a towing to start the car and I offered to pay since they didn't take debit, she said she'd pay me back next time. (more on this later)		I was always myself and encouraged her to keep talking to guys and she'll meet someone because shes super awesome. She said she didn't need to look for anyone anymore (I didn't get it at the time) and gave me a ride home (it was only a few blocks) So when she dropped me off, I wished her good night and that It would be cool to hangout again.		She offered to take me out for lunch soon to pay me back.	So I said thanks and went home by myself (I was totally clueless that she wanted to get in) 	So 2 days later she messaged me to take me out (that soon?) and I offered to cook her supper instead since I like cooking.	We talked about music and life and people and it was so much fun.		Come might time I offered to have her sleep on the sofa or in my bed (and I'd sleep on the sofa) She said she wanted to be held because it had been a long time for her. So I held her all night but never made a move. 	It was really cool but I've cuddled with friends before and it's not a big deal. 		So a few days later she ask to hang out again, I said sure but thought it was weird to hang out twice on a weekday. 		So we repeat what we did the last time shes over, talked and talked for hours... And when we went to bed, she takes off her clothes and I go: Ohhhhhh!!! 	she looks at me and says: yeah. (as in, I've been hitting on you for a while now and you never got it)		So pretty much, I'm dating my friend now :D	I'm learning a lot with her, like how to love myself and come out of my shell a bit.	We've been unofficially dating for 2 weeks now and I feel like I found the flame I was looking for. It's amazing.		What I mean by my story (and thanks for reading btw) is: be yourself, be a friend first, if she likes you, she'll let you know. Worst case, you just made a good friend! Winwin!			Edit: English is my second language, I hope my phrase structures aren't so bad. 	I hope this story helps :D	Life is amazing. Keep being your awesome self. 	 			  
I sure hope so. Things feel awfully empty right now. Gotta have a little sadness once in a while, so you know when the good times come.

Turk and JD loved being alone together.		Edit despite all the evidence to the contrary they weren't really married 	   If they had come out and got married in the final season I wouldn't have even been surprised. They were the best relationship any pair of tv characters have ever had.
Idk man have you tried LSD?Try LSD with your best friend. 
Is that off of molly? Yea. I love Molly it's completely different from his other stuff but that might be why
No, I don't do this. Whenever I see my significant other looking at cat pics on an iPad alone I just yell at them "HAHAHA YOU'RE STUPID, ARE YOU BEING QUIET ON REDIT? I HATE REDDIT AND QUIET AND ATHEISM AND CATS AND MEMES AND BATTLE FIELD TWELVE!" That's how my relationship works.I know you're joking but I've had  relationships in the past where the person was so uncomfortable with silence, so *desperate* to talk non-stop, that this was pretty much reality.

Oh, I always thought Turk was Indian and that his last name was AndjaydeeI always thought Turkleton sounded like a good name for a turtle.
Dude, they were a little married>Dude, ~~they~~ **we** ~~were~~ **are** a little married 		JD : "*I know I love it*"		 
Carla will NEVER understand him like JD does"*Good question Turk*" 		
Try LSD with your best friend. As long as you have a sober person to babysit, especially if it's your first time.
Yea. I love Molly it's completely different from his other stuff but that might be whyThat song hit me so hard at the end of the music video... shit...
Hey friend my english is not the best I dont really understand your question :(		Do you mean what my lost was, or if I stopped smoking trees?:)Your username, friendo.

I'm not arguing how you feel, I'm arguing the objective fact. The only difference in different types of drunkeness are the extra outside sources like caffeine. There is literally no difference between beer and wine drunk. If you feel that way, it's purely anecdotal and placebo."Hey, I saw you guys having fun over there talking about things that don't matter! Well, I'm here to ruin your fun with facts that also don't matter!"    	- You
I always thought Turkleton sounded like a good name for a turtle."You think my name is Turk Turkleton?" 
I always thought Turkleton sounded like a good name for a turtle.If i ever get a turtle, i will name them this in your honor.
"*Good question Turk*" 		Turk: "Baby, how come you never point out when I have good questions?"		Carla: "Because I don't love you like he does."		JD: "I told you!"
I thought that song was about doing ENope. All about a girl he was with before he got really into rap and how he feels about the fact that he couldn't/can't have both her and rap and he chose rap. It's really a beautiful song
Speak for yourself.I love you on this blessed day 
Your username, friendo.Now Ive understood it thanks for that friend :)
He's referencing your username, implying that the love of your life (that you lost) is/was weed. Oh haha weed is the second love of my life :)
"You think my name is Turk Turkleton?" "Your skin is wrinkly"
"You think my name is Turk Turkleton?" "And Mrs. Turkleton!"		I named my dog Turk Turkleton because of that line.
Turk: "Baby, how come you never point out when I have good questions?"		Carla: "Because I don't love you like he does."		JD: "I told you!"Carla: "I swear Turk, sometimes I think you and J.D. are more of a couple than we are."		J.D.: "Tell her I've known you longer."
Babysit?When someone is on LSD, and especially if they are inexperienced with it, it's safest to have a sober person "babysit" them, and keep them out of trouble.
Nope. All about a girl he was with before he got really into rap and how he feels about the fact that he couldn't/can't have both her and rap and he chose rap. It's really a beautiful songAnd Brendan Urie kills the chorus.

I love you on this blessed day What a day. What a lovely day.
I love you on this blessed day GOOD point.
"Your skin is wrinkly"Yeah? Well that shirt makes you look gay. 
When someone is on LSD, and especially if they are inexperienced with it, it's safest to have a sober person "babysit" them, and keep them out of trouble.ooooh... gotcha.  I was thinking "That's a mighty strong assumption" as if you were assuming they had kids.  		Thanks for letting me know :)
What a day. What a lovely day.Sometimes Reddit really makes me feel warm inside.  :)
No one ever wants to DD that ride, so we made a rule that if anyone is inexperienced, we need a veteran aka someone that has done it over a dozen times.  And this very idea was the impetus for Wavy Gravy and the Hog Farmers at Woodstock. They had 'freak out' tents where those who were novices or were tripping out of control could be 'talked down'. And then, once they had regained their control, they would stay behind and help out with the next person.		This psychological approach was found to work quite well, as opposed to the medical staff there,who were more prone to just want to sedate the trippers with Thorazine, which bummed out the trip altogether.  	Most often one just needs a bit of talking down.	At least that's how it was way, way back in the day.
