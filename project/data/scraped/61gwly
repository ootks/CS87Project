HE GOT TO PET HIMDoes anyone know what the original photo is that inspired his trip?
HE GOT TO PET HIMI alter the route of my walk specifically because there is a cat that lets me pet him on that block.   It feels like an incomplete walk when he's not out in his yard for me to love.

Does anyone know what the original photo is that inspired his trip?This was done by a Reddit user named /u/ObviousPlant who puts up signs like this, so I don't think there was a real picture.
Does anyone know what the original photo is that inspired his trip?It's not real. The logo in the lower right hand corner is Obvious Plant and it's a guy who makes funny fake stuff like that.
I alter the route of my walk specifically because there is a cat that lets me pet him on that block.   It feels like an incomplete walk when he's not out in his yard for me to love. True happiness is finding a stranger cat that wants pets. 
I can't wait until this is me. Tipper B. is obviously a dog's name, I feel as though everyone is misreading the article...

True happiness is finding a stranger cat that wants pets. I just moved to a new house. One of my first days walking from the bus stop, I saw a GIANT albino cat behind some shrubs. I stood in front of it, and he leaped over them, walked up to me, and stood up, with his front paws on my leg. Got up to nearly my waist. Asking for pets and after said pets were given, he walked home with me, just a slow wander. When we got there, he rolled over and I gave him some belly rubs. I then went inside and got a treat for him, after which he wandered off home. I see him every week or so and we do the same thing. Don't know who's cat, where he lives, or anything, but I like our friendship.
Tipper B. is obviously a dog's name, I feel as though everyone is misreading the article...I don't understand your logic here.... how could this have been misread? Why would a dog be talking about petting another dog?
Tipper B. is obviously a dog's name, I feel as though everyone is misreading the article...Tipper is a human name too, though. How can we tell which name belongs to the other?
