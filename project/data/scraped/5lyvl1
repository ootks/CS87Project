This was only weird because my parents and their friends were dirty hippie climbers.

Impress the kid from the start.The brother needs to always wear a suit around the kid. Make the child think that the brother always wears a suit and be the wise, cool uncle to influence a generation of young men that always wear suits. 
Impress the kid from the start.With this kind of thinking, this guy is going places. Imagine how he'll present himself for an interview at the bakery.
Impress the kid from the start.This is such a great way to express his excitement, love it! 
Impress the kid from the start.Being an uncle is hands down the best experience I've had. 		 Most of my family lives in Saskatchewan while I reside on the west coast so I only see them every year or two. 		If I can't make it out to visit I mail them a written letter and send out gifts for birthdays and Christmas.  It's great when the oldest tries to write back and spells my RL name phonetically as "chraavis" 		 But when I do go back I show up out of the blue with gifts and crappy magic tricks that only a kid would love and they (my nephews, ages 5, 6, and 1.5) are always happy to see me.    		I always try to make my visits with them memorable.  We go on adventures, we've been to ball pits, waterparks, corn mazes, and if it rains we break out the nerf guns or lego.   I just try to keep it fun.  Obviously the youngest doesn't take part yet but he's seen how great it is and I am sure between bottle and nap time he is thinking about getting in on it.		I try to be a role model and use my manners around them and remain positive even if someone falls down or Mom and Dad have an argument in earshot of us. While I hope some of it sticks with them I can understand if it gets lost in all the fun.		Then of course when time comes to fly home I board my flight with tears in my eyes and my nephews can return to regular lives and think about the next time Uncle default-client comes to visit. 
Impress the kid from the start.this is awesome
Impress the kid from the start.On the other hand, The baby might not leave so good an impression. Not only will he not be wearing a suit, he will also be naked and covered in blood and fluid and probably in a pretty bad mood. I hope it won't reflect poorly on him in the future 
Impress the kid from the start.Awww
Impress the kid from the start.This made my day. 		Good on ya, uncle. 
Impress the kid from the start.Remember, eye contact and a firm handshake.
Impress the kid from the start.Whenever I meet a newborn for the first time, I shake their hand and formally introduce myself. You never know if they're gonna grow up to be important, and I want to get in on the ground floor.
Impress the kid from the start.Her brother looks like ~~Plop~~ Dwight Jr. from The Office 		Edit: got the 2 customer service reps mixed up
Impress the kid from the start.Haha I'm sure he also is thinking that those Instagram/Facebook pictures will be around forever, so might as well look awesome! ;)
Impress the kid from the start.Yeah but I bet that kid shows up naked and screaming incoherently. He's probably drunk. What's going on with kids these day? 
Impress the kid from the start.For a while my things were bicycles and I would collect odd types of bike because they're so much fun. I was working at my job (Universal Studios in Orlando) when my sister went into labor (about 6 years ago). 		I biked to my house in a hurry in a 70s Bianchi foldable bike I got off craigslist for like $70. If you know about bikes, you know that 10 inch rims are not meant for long distance. 		I was so excited, after I got ready I decided to bike to the hospital as a gift to my nephew. I wouldn't pollute in his name. So I got ready then I biked to downtown Orlando in a matter of minutes. 		I was sweating and crying the whole way. I was so excited that the bike was the perfect way to relieve all the energy I had. I'm tearing up just thinking about it. Holding him in my arms and seeing his eyes made me feel a type of happiness I've never experienced. LSD, shrooms, a few other psychedelics, weed, alcohol, sex. Nothing compared to that.		So happy this guy has so much dedication/consideration for his family. 
Impress the kid from the start.Seems all my family members are basically shitty, so this is especially cool for me to see.

I wonder if that actually works?		I mean, I know babies don't record memories at that age, but they are generating brain cells at a faster rate than any other point in their lives, and the direction those cells generate in is influenced by their experience, so maybe it will actually do something.		Something inperceptable by the child, even when they grow up but a subtle influence from a forgotten time.And most of all, his attitude about family and his responsibility and excitement about being an uncle just bleeds from the screen - kids know who is down and who's not from such an early age. This guy has it right. My parents always told me, "start as you mean to go on." Perfect example!
Seems all my family members are basically shitty, so this is especially cool for me to see.I'm not shitty and we can be family.

He just doesn't care		Edit: not referring to people who are busy but make an effort when they see their nieces and nephews. In my own personal experience, I've had uncles who will only talk to me if i start the conversation and even then, only talk about the weather or the route they drove to get there. They worked 9-5 factory jobs or were retired and their kids were grown. They just preferred to sit there and drink their beer than have anything to do with me.

Be the last kind!Mine doesn't quite fit into that. My favourite uncle was a chaplain in the RAF, and whenever he would be stationed somewhere he would get gifts for us. He was incredibly kind, and even when he had progressed very far in his cancer he never stopped smiling. I asked him once why he seemed so young even though he was in his seventies, and he said that Proverbs 17:22a was his inspiration when he was going through some difficult times abroad: "A joyful heart is good medicine."		He told me that you are as young as you choose to be, and if you never let go of childlike wonder, you will never really be "old." He was the uncle who would come visit and would love to hear about anything we loved. Our happiness was his happiness, all the way up to the end. The doctors thought it amazing that he lived a few years beyond the date he was supposed to die of cancer, but I think his joyful spirit and regular fitness routine kept him going. 			**TL;DR** Be the uncle that your nieces and nephews smile when thinking about, even after you're gone. You don't need to be perfect, you just need to be loving.

So there's that kind.Hey, I guess sending a package every month counts for something, regardless of what's in it, right?
Figure out what your siblings refuse to buy for their children, then buy that for their Christmas/birthday gifts.  Shower them in airsoft guns, M rated games, and R rated movies.I gave my niece a horse mask a few years ago, and they still use it all the time. 		I'll never forget the look of annoyance on their mothers face when she asked me "did you buy my daughter a horse mask?"

Just be yourself. Then, nothing can go wrong!Unless you're a pedo, then try not to be yourself.
Math addict uncle You know you got it bad if you're uncle is so addicted to math, all he'll ever do with you is teaching algebra.
If it's a he buy him a console for one of his birthdays with cool games and game with him from time to time. Lots of girls like to game too btw...
Who said that cool uncles can't be drunk? Because I sure am. Druncle
It's not used much over here either. OP is probably still in High SchoolI'm 25 :(
Cake off? I've no idea what this means. FUCK:KCUF
This is an interesting comment on the popular content aggregation  website "reddit".This is a comment imitating the overly infotmative nature of the previous comment
Birthday suit up!		Always confuses my husband when I use that as the sexytime callI did this once and my husband and I laughed to much to do anything :D
Birthday suit up!		Always confuses my husband when I use that as the sexytime callI'm stealing this. This is mine now.  Thank you. 
You motherfuckerIt was a piece of cake for him to do that.
I think you mean Jonah Hill from anything where he wears a suit I think you mean the kid from Christmas Story after hitting puberty
Noisy toys with buttons are fun, but it's also great getting things like kazoos that make noise even when the parents say that the batteries have "gone missing".Haha yep. I got them some pennywhistles when I went to Ireland. The best part is the two whistles are in different keys. So even if they miraculously learned how to play them, and play them well, it still sounds awful.
Noisy toys with buttons are fun, but it's also great getting things like kazoos that make noise even when the parents say that the batteries have "gone missing".I once had a frenemy that would invited me to her children's birthday parties. I gifted a Fisher Price corn popper push toy. The one year old loved it and the mom hated it.  Mission accomplished. Every year I gave that kid the noisiest gift I could find. After I found and gifted the toy drum set, I wasn't invited back for the next birthday. 
I have a belly so I told my nephew I'm pregnant.  He thinks I'm an anomaly, since I'm a man, but he's convinced.  He gets freaked out when I let him feel the baby kick.  This has been going on for at least two years now.  He thinks it's a slow bake baby.  Found out he's been telling his friends at school about my miracle.  My ex s-i-l hates me for it (and because I make him call me Uncle Awesome).  That makes me commit even more.  How do you make the baby kick? My first strategy would be farts.
I want to be this kind of uncle but my nieces live about 1100 miles away :(I only ever saw my cool uncle every year or so, he is still my cool uncle even though I'm now 35.

You forgot the apathetic kind you hardly ever see but isn't a bad guy. He just doesn't care		Edit: not referring to people who are busy but make an effort when they see their nieces and nephews. In my own personal experience, I've had uncles who will only talk to me if i start the conversation and even then, only talk about the weather or the route they drove to get there. They worked 9-5 factory jobs or were retired and their kids were grown. They just preferred to sit there and drink their beer than have anything to do with me.I have no experience with that kind. I think that's better than 1 and 2 of my examples though!

You forgot about the infamous drunkleEh that one kind of mixes with the racist uncle, also with inappropriate comments about teenage girls uncle.  
You also forgot the creepy uncle I also have a creepy uncle. He's handsy, but not quite over the top handsy. Kisses me on the neck when he sees me, says I'm looking good. that kind of creepy.
I find that the cool uncle and the racist uncle can sometimes overlap. Yeah, he's a cool dude, but damned if he isn't also quietly racist about everything. For me, it's cool and weird although he hasn't been to prison. He's just irresponsible with money and only works the most unstable job he possibly can. 		Cool guy though. Love him to death. 
Mine is some how all 3. Love him to death. He'll go to hell and back for me. Is your uncle Sirius Black?
I gave my niece a horse mask a few years ago, and they still use it all the time. 		I'll never forget the look of annoyance on their mothers face when she asked me "did you buy my daughter a horse mask?" When I first read "horse mask" I thought of a bridle and was wondering how they could use that... and then I remembered the horse mask meme.
Are they puppies?Humans, too, enjoy outdoor activities.
You know you got it bad if you're uncle is so addicted to math, all he'll ever do with you is teaching algebra.Does it count if that is my brother?		We are both in college right now(he is a PhD student, I'm still getting my bachelors), every time I see him, he tries to teach me whatever he is researching at the time, and that generally involves teaching me quite a bit of abstract algebra and high level calculus...		Still love him anyways :)

I got my nieces a drum kit when they were younger a year or so ago. It worked great until they took a poop in the drum. 		But it was still a win.

Jokes aside, I do the same to my little brother, atlhough not on the same academic level (I'm finishing my engineering bachelor, he's in high-school), to test wether I actually understand it myself. Either I'll be able to explain it to him, or I'll hit a struggle somewhere long the way and know what I need to study again.		So I'd just like to thank you (and all the little brothers out there) for your sacrifice, it helps a lot !

He was bread for opportunity.At yeast he put the effort in.
How'd he do it?I don't know, maybe by always treating me a slightly older than I was when I was a kid? When I was a teenager he talked to me about music a lot, both my age music and cool older music. And we've always talked about books. When I was in my late teens he'd joke about underage drinking. When I was over 18 he'd talk to me about going out to bars. Whenever he comes to my city he always rings and makes plans to catch up, and asks advice on what to do and where to take his kids. Now I have a kid he rings and asks how she is.	Really, he just treats me like a friend rather than someone younger than him, I guess. And he makes an effort to stay in touch.
