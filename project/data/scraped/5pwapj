heckin' destroyed by nice islam manWell Muslims consider Christians to also be people of the book.
That guy must have felt like shit doubtful. it'd be nice, but people who'd post antagonistic things like this generally don't have capacity for self-awareness, at least not enough to feel shame, anyways.
That guy must have felt like shit Nah, he's probably livid they didn't respond in a way that he could escalate his bigotry. 
That guy must have felt like shit Hopefully he had a life-changing realisation about the futility of hate and decided to donate more stuff.
That guy must have felt like shit I doubt it. He probably just rolled his eyes. Heck, there's virtually no way he'd intended to send them anything except a snotty message, so his work was done as soon as he hit send. 		There's an interesting and subtle potential dig in there that I like--the mosque will use the bacon to feed the hungry, which needs doing...because maybe other people (e.g., Christians) aren't doing it? I'm pretty sure there's nothing in the Bible about sending people bacon as a passive-aggressive insult to their religious beliefs, but there totally *is* something in there about feeding the hungry. 
That guy must have felt like shit He got his 10 likes, he was probably just disappointed his comment didn't earn him more fake Internet points.

What people don't understand is that there's primitive people in every religion. Every religion at one point or another has resulted in death or in bringing hope to people.And the vast majority of those people live in impoverished countries that would be afflicted by systematic violence anyways. Religion is just one vehicle for hate and frustration in inhospitable and/or oppressive nations. Mexico is war-torn by armed insurgent violence but nobody suggests Catholicism is inherently violent because they recognize that the root cause is the drug trade; in the Middle East, the issues are somewhat more obscure, but drought, famine, and totalitarianism are still clearly hurting people, irrespective of religious zealotry. The United States is far from perfect but comparatively it's extremely wealthy and peaceful, so there's no reason to believe the 3 million Muslim Americans are any different from any other religious group. The few radicalized Muslim terrorists that have been Americans cited foreign terrorist groups as inspiration, and these groups recruit by pointing to anti-Islamic rhetoric in the United States. As in every other country on Earth, violence will follow poverty and oppression, so anti-Islamic sentiment leading to the suggestion or implementation of oppressive policies will incite far more Islamic terrorism by mentally ill and isolated people looking for an outlet than it will ever prevent.

I love you moreWholesome 
I love you moreMe too thanks. 
I love lamp Do you really love the lamp, or are you just saying that because you saw it?
Now I'm imaging some prepper like dude standing in a room full of bacon and bibles Ha! Shows how much you know. It's bacon, bibles, and bullets!
Now I'm imaging some prepper like dude standing in a room full of bacon and bibles You joke, but I work with a guy that essentially has a bank vault for a basement. There are, at last count, 25+ Bibles, and enough supplies to feed all of Baltimore for a week.
maybe seriously wasn't the right word.		my apologiesDont apologize buddy, words are meant to convey intent and we all understood your intent :)
maybe seriously wasn't the right word.		my apologiesThey responded seriously, even if they presumed he wasn't.
Frist of all how **dare** yo u shill for onions in this wholesome place, and besmirch the good name of the wholesome network with your false subredditDon't forget /r/pupliftingnews they're pretty wholesome too!
Looks like your GoogleFu is weak my dear friend. The one you claimed and linked is from Christmas 2015, but this one happened in February 2015 - caused by then 56-year-old homeless guy. 		[Actual link here](http://m.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-charged-mosque-fire-denies-hatred-muslims-article-1.2480567) I hope the guy turns out OK.  It really sound like it was an accident; he started it in a shed he didn't know was attached to the mosque, he had multiple character witnesses saying that this wasn't like him, and it was so cold out.  The poor man just wanted to stay warm.  He sounds like he is a victim to his own alcoholism, but that he changed.  Even the Mosque forgave him and asked for charges to be dropped. 
Holy shit you're being downvoted for posting an absolutely legit news report. There's a fine line between trying to be tolerant and happy, and wilful ignorance of crimes just to appear tolerant.He linked to the wrong event. That's definitely something that should be downvoted, no? Or should everything fitting your agenda be upvoted regardless of veracity? 
God I'm so offended by whiskey and brisket, if someone mailed that to me I would be sooooo pissed.		PM me for addressYeah, you fuckers better not send me a ps4
God I'm so offended by whiskey and brisket, if someone mailed that to me I would be sooooo pissed.		PM me for addressIt would offend my religious sensibilities if someone sent me a new CPU and graphics card for my PC. Preferably something that would run Battlefield One on the highest settings. Man that would annoy me
God I'm so offended by whiskey and brisket, if someone mailed that to me I would be sooooo pissed.		PM me for addressYou know what really gets to me, really deep down in a personal way? Money. As the Wu-Tang Clan once (many times within the song actually) said, "Cash Rules Everything Around Me. (C.R.E.A.M.) Get the money; dollar dollar bills, y'all." That spoke to me on many levels. Hate cash. Can't bear to look at the stuff. It would break my heart if I saw a lot of it at once. Perhaps even more if it legally belonged to me.		I guess I'd hate it if it was transferred to my PayPal too. PM me if you want the account address to make sure nothing gets into it.

I frequent quite a few mosques. This actually happens a lot. We always donate it to those in need or find a way to turn it in to something positive though. Good on you guys for handling it in such a classy way
I think that is something more religious parents say to scare their kids into not touching it. 		They also say that any part of your body that touches alcohol will never get to heaven. 		None of that is based in the Quran or Islam, any action can always be forgiven. Allah has hundreds of names in the Quran, one of the most popular is Al-Rahman, the most merciful. :) Thank you for sharing these little tidbits. I've enjoyed your comments quite a bit. Your mosque sounds like a wonderful place.

I hate everyone		Edit: It was just a joke... But I forgot that you can't do that on the internet because people get offended...We still love you, and hope you can come to love yourself too.

Ha! Shows how much you know. It's bacon, bibles, and bullets!False.		Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
Ha! Shows how much you know. It's bacon, bibles, and bullets!Such a confrontational culture. Over here, all they'd get is disparaging looks and a nonverbal reminder that they're not welcome at the next neighborhood party.
You joke, but I work with a guy that essentially has a bank vault for a basement. There are, at last count, 25+ Bibles, and enough supplies to feed all of Baltimore for a week....is he afraid the bibles will spoil?

Especially when you're homeless I doubt burning down a mosque would be a top of his priority. 
Yeah, you fuckers better not send me a ps4I swear, if I see a single Corvette Z06 in my mailbox, I'm gonna lose it

The humiliation of having to touch it would be grievous.

Question, if you ordered a sandwich not knowing it had bacon on it... what is the procedure can you remove it and eat the sandwich? You should not, because it has grease and that grease has mixed with your food. Though that is between you and God. For He sees all and knows what is in ones heart. 
Question, if you ordered a sandwich not knowing it had bacon on it... what is the procedure can you remove it and eat the sandwich? To be honest it is different for each people based on their culture, but the base rule is "no pork."		My personal family and friend circle would probably just take the bacon out and eat it. When we would have pizza at neighbors houses, it used to be always pepperoni, and we would just peel them off and eat the pizza anyway. 
False.		Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.Fact: bears love beats. 		Edit: beets. I no spell good.

He said bears love beats, not beets. Now beats provided by The Beets, that's a different story.Are beats by Beats better than beets by The Beets? How about The Beets' beats and Beats' beets?
