As a Mod, you guys gave me the best birthday present today :)We all really appreciate the work you do.

As a Mod, you guys gave me the best birthday present today :)Happy birthday, it is my birthday too. :)
As a Mod, you guys gave me the best birthday present today :)What's this you've said to me, my good friend? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and I've been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.

This was an amazing comment, you literally just made my day even better. While I was reading your first sentence, I was literally thinking to myself, I will sacrifice any part of today to help this guy out....then I read the second line.  Thanks friendo!Here's a couple of things I like to do to have a memorable and fun evening. 	If you take public transport go an extra stop or one stop short. Go into the first market or bar. Talk to people.  If you drive take a random exit and do the same. 	Go out to that place you keep meaning to go to. Or that other place the one you were unsure about. Talk to the server staff. 	The point is expose yourself to new things. Something good usually comes from it. 
Thanks so much!!  So glad you found us, hope that you stay, looking forward to seeing you around here more and more friendo :)Happy birthday! Here's to another year of being wholesome, and hope you have a great day!
