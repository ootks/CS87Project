What a cool restaurant! :)I thought this was an unwholesome post about how your sister was too dull to realize that her menu was not a tablet. This post was wholesome the whole time. Happy for you guys!
What a cool restaurant! :)Truth is most corporate places probably have a braille menu in their initial inventory when they open, it just ends up in a storage closet/filing cabinet after a number of years and numerous management turnovers.
What a cool restaurant! :)I love this. It annoys me how few places care about making their shit accessible.		I work for a largehuge Evil Government Agency. My giant EGA just last year launched a system where people who needed to contact us could get in touch with an ASL agency worker. 		For those who unfamiliar, if you're deaf you may have to go through a video service to get your phone calls done. While this service is invaluable, it is also slow, expensive, and there are often gaps in understanding as you have to rely on the translator to get what you need said across.		Having an employee instead speak directly to the ASL person is a LOT faster, and results in way higher levels of comprehension. Virtually every American will have to deal with my agency *several times* in their life. This means we deal with a heck of a lot of people who are blind, deaf, or have other issues. I think it is sad that it was only 2016 when we finally decided "hey maybe we can help our deaf friendos directly!"
What a cool restaurant! :)This will speak very terrible of me, but here goes:		About 20 years ago McDonalds began offering braille menus (I believe to comply with the ADA). So on a lunch break at college, my friend and went to the local McDonalds. I screwed up my eyes and walked to the counter, and asked for the Braille menu. One eye was looking at my nose and the other was looking off in the distance.		The guy gave me the menu (they had them in a container off to the side of the counter; we had seen them in a previous visit).		I slid my hand across the braille, and then acted excited, and said "I'll have two of the 10 cent big macs please!". The guy at the counter was confused and said they were 1.89.		"no," I said, pointing to the menu. "Read it... it says right here they are 10 cents!"		But I couldn't keep it up, and started giggling... and the guy just gave me a dirty look.		Probably going to hell for it.		I'm so glad OP's sis found a restaurant that had a menu that she could read!

They see ASL as just another language, and the deaf community is a big part of their lives. That's not to discourage you from learning sign, it's really great and imo a lot easier to learn for native English speakers than other languages like Spanish (although it still does have its own grammar/syntax distinct from English), but I'd just advise you to not look at it as "helping people with a disability"

To be fair, IIRC less than 10% of blind people currently know how to read Braille, and I believe the percentage is even lower if you count serious visual impairment in general.

Even if the person comes in using a white and red cane, it seems presumptuous to just give them the Braille menu.

I bet they spent a lot of money on that one menu that was used once. Awesome of them, but I bet a braille single menu for your little restaurant costs a bunch. I doubt it really cost that much, ops picture is just a binder and the pages can be printed from a braille printer. The harder part would just be finding a print company that offer it. Might even be cheaper than the ones custom made with leather etc

If you have a frequently changing menu, then you likely have to pick up your own Braille embosser which will cost in the thousands of dollars. If your menu is more set in stone, then you can just print from a commercial printer which won't be bad if you have a place with an embosser, and if not then you can likely get something online.
#Bradswife does not feel the sameBrad's wife would offer menus in Braille 
Crackle Bargle. Order Corn.I'm sorry for your loss 
Crackle Bargle. Order Corn.WHUP TEE DOO!!!!!
I've heard of it but never been. What should I order? Breakfast food, imho. They make good pancakes and warm up the syrup for you. Biscuits are pretty decent, too :) Mostly tho, they're good because they're just about everywhere in the US and you'll always know what you're getting. They make a point of working more from scratch than most other chain restaurants.
I've heard of it but never been. What should I order? Don't get the food, just get sunglasses and a keychain and one of those really long spirally lollipops from the gift shop.
I do too. I can't go to ours though cause my douchebag ex works there. Your douchebag ex can suck 19 dicks for keeping you from the crickle darrel
ADA would be more likely to kill you for shit like not having properly sized doorways or ramp entrances.  Like imagine if every restaurant in a chain and to have a sign language translator.  Well the ADA just resulted in 20,000 UC Berkeley classroom lectures being removed from YouTube for not accommodating the deaf and blind. The DOJ doesn't do anything until people file complaints. 
I'm gonna go shave, too. My belt holds up my pants and my pants have belt loops that hold up the belt. What the fuck's really going on down there? Who is the real hero?
CAN YOU SMELLL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOOKIINGGG!Spoiler alert: it's [cod](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-eats-about-821-pounds-of-cod-per-year/) . 
It's the best sub. [deleted]
They probably would actually. I always found it odd that drive-thru ATMs had Braille on them until someone pointed out that the blind person could be in the rear driver-side seat and still use it. Also, the machines are usually the same models that they use for walk-up ATMs - no point in building one with braille and one without.

Here is his main channel [The Tommy Edison Experience](https://www.youtube.com/user/TommyEdisonXP), his video ["Mean Comments About A Blind YouTuber"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8jA15HRgSQ&index=11&list=LLpofcecgjomkAFpr8fDNukA) is one of my favorites, since it really lets his extremely positive attitude shine - but I would also reccomend his [Blind Film Critic](https://www.youtube.com/user/BlindFilmCritic/featured) account as well - really interesting to see how he picks up on different things on movies **without seeing them**. Just an amazing guy all around.Thank you!

Hey, just so you know, there's no reason to use an apostrophe to pluralize the word menu. What the restaurant could barely afford was menus, not menu's. That was a really wholesome way to educate someone on a common grammar mistake! I hope your next burrito doesn't explode. 
Hey, just so you know, there's no reason to use an apostrophe to pluralize the word menu. What the restaurant could barely afford was menus, not menu's. My man, fighting the good fight. There's been a surge in the number of people using an apostrophe for any word that ends in an s and it's driving me nuts.
I doubt it really cost that much, ops picture is just a binder and the pages can be printed from a braille printer. The harder part would just be finding a print company that offer it. Might even be cheaper than the ones custom made with leather etcPerhaps a while ago it would have been tough but there are a lot of online services now where you can just send them a PDF and you'll get a high quality bound Braille print. 		Technology can be quite wonderful at times. 
I'm sorry for your loss LOL to your family.

Biscuits are pretty decent, too :) Mostly tho, they're good because they're just about everywhere in the US and you'll always know what you're getting. They make a point of working more from scratch than most other chain restaurants.For lunch food, I always go with the chicken fried chicken (sic) with fried okra and mac n cheese. That's some real comfort food for me.
Don't get the food, just get sunglasses and a keychain and one of those really long spirally lollipops from the gift shop.My mom made the mistake of letting me buy a harmonica at a Cracker Barrel when I was a kid. The only instructions were notes for "When the saints go marching in." That's also the only thing I ever learned to play. She and the dog hated it. And probably the neighbors too.

That was a really wholesome way to educate someone on a common grammar mistake! I hope your next burrito doesn't explode. That's a very thoughtful thing to wish for someone. It's a shame when the burrito explodes and you have to finish the rest with a spoon.

That's a very thoughtful thing to wish for someone. It's a shame when the burrito explodes and you have to finish the rest with a spoon.I like to think it's like I'm getting 2 for 1. I got a burrito and a burrito bowl with extra carbs! 
That's a very thoughtful thing to wish for someone. It's a shame when the burrito explodes and you have to finish the rest with a spoon.Hey, just so you know, you can usually keep your burrito from exploding by slowly unraveling the foil or wrapping on your burrito as you eat it, which will also aide in containing its contents in case the tortilla has structural failure and has a side burst. Also, a fork may be more effective than a spoon. In any case, enjoy your burrito!
