I don't think artists in the renaissance era were comparing their work to older masters, especially cavemen.Actually, the Renaissance artists were by-and-large obsessed with Greek and Roman art, so much so that the discovery of Greco-Roman artifacts and unearthing of sealed tombs and temples around that time was cited as a direct inspiration.
[removed]Saying it with a smile doesn't make it wholesome.
[removed]What do you mean? As far as I can tell there is a more art of higher quality than there ever has been within the last few decades. In my opinion art just keeps getting better.
[removed]Sounds like you're romanticizing the past. Any particular reason you feel that way? Personally I think this is the most interesting time in history, especially in regards to art and music. Not only do we have access to all past art, but now we have all this new and interesting stuff, that also happens to be socially relevant in a way that old art isn't. I think the reason we look back on the past with such a filter is that all the unmemorable/unremarkable stuff was forgotten, making the past seem better than it really was.

One of the Lions looks like it's tilting. They understood perspective back then?Oh you are in for a treat if you're curious about that. 		An entire subsection of the art historical field focuses on the development of movement in imagery. 		To answer your question: probably. I'm no expert on prehistoric imagery, but bodily movement in images changes and fluctuates through time, so it's entirely possible. 
One of the Lions looks like it's tilting. They understood perspective back then?So I'm taking an art history class right now, so I'm claiming to have put a ton of research into this or that I'm an expert by any means, but I thought I'd just echo what I've learned on the subject.		Basically, [yeah](http://s3.amazonaws.com/presspublisher-do/upload/2697/horses2.jpg), they understood depth, detail and shading. In fact a ton of the deep cave drawings made during the neolithic period are really surprisingly well done, and those horses were made friggin 30,000 years ago! Then something weird happens when agriculture comes a long and suddenly everything is [stick figures](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/064_Pintures_de_la_cova_dels_Moros,_exposici%C3%B3_al_Museu_de_Gav%C3%A0.JPG) and abstract shapes. Those stick figures were made roughly ***24,000*** years after the horses. Seriously, it's bonkers.		Here's the thinking. In pre-agriculture times, peeps had to keep on the move in order to follow their food source. This made the making of art pretty rare as it either has to be [small enough to carry with you](http://www.dominiquenavarro.com/imagesdom/Venus%20of%20Willendorf/Venus-of-Willendorf_03.jpg) or it had to have some serious religious significance! So this large cave paintings were made by like shamans and stuff with the thought that the animals on the walls would guide the local medicine man safely into the spirit world or whatever. For that reason they put a lot of effort into making the pictures do the real creatures justice.		Then people start settling down and so more people have time to make paintings. Now they aren't doing it so much out of religious desire and more for telling stories and keeping record of their people. Less skilled people are painting now, and they are spending less time making sure it's perfect and accurate the first time because they can just make more later. Real interesting stuff.

Farkas and was blown away by his [artistic interpretation of the structure of a proton.](http://members.iif.hu/visontay/ponticulus/video/posters/neutron123.jpg) Beauty really is subjective, and while some things tend to be appealing to more people, I don't believe that objectively makes them more beautiful.		Also I think the earth being round has been well-accepted fact since like 300 B.C.

Now here's a little lesson in trickery This is going down in history
Thanks Satan! I prefer Diet Devil.
Wait whatIt was in the Super Mario Galaxy play-through, when Danny lamented his poor art skills. Arin, who did quite a bit of animation a while back (i.e. Metal Gear Awesome) explained that the only reason he's good at drawing is because he practiced a lot.		He then likened the idea of always being good at something to absurdity, such as if he emerged from his mother's vaginal canal drawing fuckin' Mozart.
It used to be objective. "Beauty in the eye of the beholder" being a commonplace belief is a relatively recent phenomenon, somewhere within the last century.		And like I said, there is awesome work out there right now but personally I just don't think it rivals with the architecture and other things we were building/creating in real life.What? No it didn't. Philosophers from Plato to Hume have been discussing subjective standards of taste and art. You are just factually wrong. 		What IS true is that there were less forms of art, which you seem to be confusing as evidence of objectivity. What this really shows is that you're unwilling to consider new perspectives, a key and necessary ingredient in the entire history of the development of art. 
>there has always been huge controversy in art		I wouldn't say huge, hence many objective art cultures surviving and improving on a relatively stable scale for hundreds of years within their nations. The times we are living in are profoundly different than the old days. It's best not to look at the past through the goggles of modernity.Can you give me a single example of an artistic landscape that remained unchanged for hundreds of years?
Again, this is a new phenomenon and you speak like its a universal truth. Beauty wasn't always subjective, culturally speaking.[deleted]
> what's the point		Terrible attitude!! We should always strive to get closer and closer to perfection. That is literally the main engine that powered our art for hundreds of years, like the picture in OP describes. We always wanted to be great like the masters, and leaving that as a constant force for artists to aspire to is, in my opinion, necessary for a healthy art culture. People see it as negative because sometimes we might not be as good as the masters, but that is where effort, hard work, and dedication can make us not only better artists, but better people as well :)>Terrible attitude!! We should always strive to get closer and closer to perfection. 		What you're describing isn't "closer to perfection." It's just lack of ambition and fear of trying something new. Modern artists haven't stopped striving for perfection. They're just doing it in different ways.
[removed]Same, but not sarcastic.
Well that's just rude.You don't get to complain about rudeness when you're being arrogant. The decline you speak of is subjective to your perspective. There is no objective beauty. You're being down voted because in a sub where kindness is the #1 rule, you're presenting a negative opinion as fact. That's what makes your comment not wholesome.
I guess it's just my opinion but I will stand by it - there has been a tremendous decline in art. I am judgemental; observation and conviction are our only truly unalienable rights as human beings. To say that I'm objectively wrong is kind of ironic when trying to argue against my point, is it not? Anyway, I just find that atomized individualistic art culture to be less wholesome than something everyone can come together and agree upon.Not that you shouldn't have opinions, but you didn't want to discuss the topic and that could include people telling you you're wrong.		I just think discounting art because it's new is the wrong outlook to have. The whole point of this comic is that you can only see true greatness in hindsight and 100 years from now someone will say there hasn't been great art since before 2000.		Saying there aren't GOAT artists anymore isn't very wholesome I'm because there are probably a lot of artists in this thread that want to strive for greatness but there are always people who will shoot them down because their ideas are modern and different, so they're inherently bad.
This is very true. But I think there is a big difference between Photoshop art which you can make errors on and press undo, with real art where if you make one big mistake you have to start all over again. It's just an entirely different craft with entirely different ways to appreciate it.You don't start over if you mess up with traditional art tho.  Erasers are a thing, and with paint you let the mistake dry and do it over (editing) or wipe it off (undo).  I practice art digitally and traditionally.  They're both absolutely art.		If you meant "real art" to mean "traditional art", disregard this.
>That's pretty dumb.		Well geez people get hostile real quick here. What happened to this sub? First week this place was only inhabited by nice people.sorry I guess I should have added a smiley at the end lmao.
The thing is that if your work survives, you really don't know 'cause you'll be death, whereas if you have fun or find meaning in your own work, you'll know. You don't know if your work survives.	You also don't know how long your work will survive. Someday no one will know who Picasso is. Sure, that may be after all humans are dead, but it will happen eventually.

What this really shows is that you're unwilling to consider new perspectives, a key and necessary ingredient in the entire history of the development of art. Except he's right. Art absolutely had a standard in so many cultures, that's not opinion - it's fact. A lot of famous artistic styles in the 19th and early 20th centuries were born from the rejection of these classical "necessities" in art.

A manly [pooh](https://cdn.drawception.com/images/panels/2012/4-3/KTFDpHrrzs-4.png) that shoulder presses other poopI'm not sure what those things are, but they should go see a doctor as soon as they can. 
If you want to be an artist, number 1Something related to art + "on the run"
Except he's right. Art absolutely had a standard in so many cultures, that's not opinion - it's fact. A lot of famous artistic styles in the 19th and early 20th centuries were born from the rejection of these classical "necessities" in art.

It was about how only art of certain styles is aesthetically pleasing, which 1) implies no one makes "classical style" art anymore (they do), 2) that all art from this fabled, undated period of "real art" all fit into the box OP is trying to imply, and 3) none of the styles rejecting classical ideas have any artistic merit whatsoever. 
Beauty being an objective quality of the world was the ethos of artistic culture for hundreds of years. I don't have much else to say besides that. Sorry.It was objective from their point of view, which kinda makes it subjective.		Not attacking you, didn't downvote you either, mind. Opinions are opinions! :)

Sure, there are hundreds of cultures with beautiful art histories that show this in action to choose from! Roman art is a great example, so we'll start there. Even if you exclude the thousands of years of ancient Roman art (which is all similar in many ways) you can see consistency through the Roman Empire's art which existed from 27BC to 1453AD. Everything you see [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=roman+art+sculpture+bc&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY-6C_uIPSAhVC42MKHRE7AfgQ_AUICCgB&biw=1673&bih=967#tbm=isch&q=roman+art+sculpture) comes from within those time periods. I'd say that's a good example of VERY clear objectivity and long-standing artistic tradition. Hope that helps :)But if the beauty of that art is so supposedly objective, why did so many varying styles of art evolve from isolated cultures? Would you not suppose that the "objectivity" of the beauty of that art is just a collective, societal, accumulation of personal view of beauty? My specialty is music, and I know that now we listen to music (considered universally beautiful) that was considered radically disgusting in the past.

Follow those sculptures chronologically, and you can see revolutionary changes in perspectives throughout time. You can see different styles from attempted photorealism to stoicism. Sculpting individual busts and likenesses to entire scenes and events with varying amounts of detail given to different subjects in the work based on which art-culture was predominant at that specific time. I agree that change took much longer back then, but you can't seriously believe that it just didn't happen.
Asian culture did the same thing for hundreds and hundreds of years. I'm not sure what you're missing here. Go look at Roman art between 27 BC and 1400 AD. Objective artist beauty, whether or not it "actually" existed, was a thing. It is very unwholesome to deny reality.> Go look at Roman art between 27 BC and 1400 AD. 		Just because artistic culture in that specific place at that specific time was stagnant, small, unambitious, and closed off from other perspectives doesn't mean "objective" beauty was a thing. 		> Objective artist beauty, whether or not it "actually" existed, was a thing. It is very unwholesome to deny reality. 		Just stop. This isn't even a debate. You're just objectively wrong. Their art looked similar because that's what their culture thought was beautiful. There were many other cultures around the world that thought very differently of what was beautiful at that time, so no, this thing you're calling "objective beauty" simply was not a thing. Your hypocrisy and outright misinformation is what's unwholesome. That's why you're being downvoted. 
And that is why I believe in the decline.Alright, well you have fun looking at soulless photorealism and whining about society falling apart because kids these days, and I'll look at art that makes me feel things. Or maybe you can just do what you said and stick to art from before WWII, like Duchamp's Fountain (1917) or Stravinsky's Rite of Spring (1913). After all, you're clearly really knowledgeable about art, and didn't pull your cutoff for when art started "declining" out of your ass.
And now you're being rude too. Whether or not some people want to accept it, objective beauty was a thing, and it was everything for artists for quite some time."objetive beauty is a thing to me and a lot of people!" well is not for me. You know what that means? It means is subjective. 
>You don't start over if you mess up with traditional art tho.		Oh, but you do! This was and still is the hardest part about sculpting. There's more art than just things you can erase with rubber.		Also I don't see things as "traditional" and "non-traditional" art. I just value objective beauty standards over personal expression, but this opinion of course can only be seen as something subjective in modern art culture since objectivity is all but dead.What do you, personally, start over with, if you mess up?  I work with clay, I paint, I draw, I craft.  There's never been a time where I put a lot of effort into a piece, and then had to completely start over due to a single mistake.  Not ever.  My dog sat on a drying canvas once, that's the only time, and the same thing would happen if she unplugged my computer while I was doing digital art.		Traditional art means art that isn't digital.  Digital art is self-explanatory.  You can't just not believe in terms that mean something.  Traditional art as a term has nothing to do with time periods or expression.
Well, I mean, it sounds like everyone else read him sharing his opinion as insisting it's fact but the way he came off to me entirely sounded like he was stating his opinion and people were jumping up saying that there's no basis for him to even think that one certain art style is superior to another.The point is his/her use of 'objective' for what is essentially his/her opinion. Nothing wrong with having an opinion, claiming it is objective that's what people don't like.
>It was objective from their point of view, which kinda makes it subjective.		Great point!! But, on a societal scale I would still say that it was far more "objective" in a sense than just one individual's idea of objective beauty, making it far more profound to think about.I can see exactly where you're coming from, like, a greater artistic collective rather than many more minor sub-cultures, if I understand you right. Personally, I prefer the individual having more power to decide what is and isn't beautiful. But, like I said, I appreciate what you're saying.

> Would you not suppose that the "objectivity" of the beauty of that art is just a collective, societal, accumulation of personal view of beauty? 		That is exactly what I think it is. It is still subjective to that entire society, which I think makes it all the more beautiful and appreciable from an outside perspective. A whole society appreciating something is far more powerful than just one individual's opinion.But wouldn't you consider modernist movements to be a form of that societal appreciation of a specific aspect of art, with that aspect being newness? 
You misread my post, I said it *was* a thing. Of course it is gone now, people clearly react rabidly against it without even reading clearly.How do you explain the wildly different standards of artistic beauty between say Western Europe, the Middle East and China in the past?
Clay is one thing, but try sculpting with stone or wood and you'll see what I mean.I see. So clay sculptures, paintings, and pencil drawings aren't real art?

What evidence did you provide for your claims? "Philosophers from Plato to Hume" is not evidence, lol. I'm sorry, but I don't think you're here to have a discussion.
