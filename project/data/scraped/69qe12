Kindness.I don't know if it's a sore throat, or r/wholesomememes. 
Kindness.I saw a similar act of kindness from an old homeless man, who walked a lady who had a panic attack into the hospital where I work. He held her hand like she was his daughter, telling her to breath, that he wouldn't let anything happen to her. 		We tried to give him a few dollars, or just a bite to eat in the lunch room, but he wouldn't take a dime. The lady and I have tried to find that old man for a gift. But I haven't seen him since :C
Kindness.You know what would be even more awesome? If we created a society where homelessness doesn't exist. One can dream, right? 
Kindness.How did she do that? I'd like to know more about this. 
Kindness.While I understand this is a good thing, isn't it a bit unfortunate that a homeless person needs to do a good deed before they are rewarded?

Wait, why did they blur the knees?The main theory right now is that they're considered lewd by Metro UK. 		It could be that they use software to automatically detect faces and then manually remove the face-blurs on the faces they actually want to show. Whoever is responsible for removing the face blurs didn't notice that the knees were accidentally targeted by the software and so left the blur over the knees.

I heard a version of this where the mouse pulled a thorn out of the lion's paw :)Maybe you're thinking of [Androcles and the Lion](http://www.storynory.com/2007/04/29/androcles-and-the-lion/)?		> It happened in ancient times that a slave named Androcles escaped from his master and fled into the forest, and he wandered there for a long time until he was weary.		> Just then he heard a lion near him moaning and groaning and at times roaring terribly.  And when  he tried to get up, there he saw the lion coming towards him.		> Instead of attacking him it kept on moaning and groaning and looking at Androcles, who saw that the lion was holding out his right paw, which was covered with blood and very much swollen. Looking more closely at it, Androcles saw a great big thorn pressed into the paw, which was the cause of all the lions trouble.		> Plucking up courage, he seized hold of the thorn and drew it out of the lions paw, who roared with pain when the thorn came out, but soon after found such relief from it that he rubbed up against Androcles, and showed  that he knew, that he was truly thankful for being relieved from such pain.		> One day, a number of soldiers came marching through the forest and found Androcles. They took him prisoner and brought him back to the town, and he was condemned to death because he had fled from his master.		> Now it used to be the custom to throw murderers and other criminals to the lions,  and on the appointed day he was led forth into the arena.		> The Emperor of Rome was in the royal box that day and gave the signal for the lion to come out and attack Androcles. But when it came out of its cage and got near Androcles, what do you think it did? Instead of jumping upon him, it rubbed up against him, and stroked him with its paw.		> It was of course the lion which Androcles had met in the forest. The Emperor summoned Androcles to him. So Androcles told the Emperor all that had happened to him and how the lion was showing gratitude for his having relieved it of the thorn. Thereupon, the emperor pardoned Androcles and ordered his master to set him free, while the lion was taken back into the forest and let loose to enjoy freedom once more.		In the version I read in Latin, Androcles took refuge in a cavern where the lion lived, and there's where the thorn thing happened. Then they lived there together for a few years before Androcles was captured after leaving the cave. And when they were set free, they roamed the streets together, and the townspeople said "there goes the lion who is a host to the man, and the man who is a doctor to the lion".

Would you mind helping me with percentages? If 3 is 100%, then 3x7000=21,000??3 = 100%		30 = 1000%		300 = 10,000%		3,000 = 100,000%		21,000 = 700,000%		Might help to look at it this way. 
Would you mind helping me with percentages? If 3 is 100%, then 3x7000=21,000??Rather take the 21,000 earned divided by the original 3 invested: 21,000/3 = 7000, take the answer times 100 as 1% = 0.01 => 700,000% increase in value 
I've read that story a dozen times and still every time I tear up. It's such a lovely display of human empathy and wholesomeness.I summarized the story to my gf over coffee today and she cried. Such a good story, even my botched storytelling couldn't take away from it. 
I've read that story a dozen times and still every time I tear up. It's such a lovely display of human empathy and wholesomeness.It's pretty amazing.    	If I read "Today you, tomorrow me" on some motivational poster, I'd think it was nice... and forget about it within a week.		That post, though... Good vibes. One of the things I think Reddit has actually influenced me on.
yeah, man! yeah! that's some good shit right therehttp://imgur.com/Ey2yx1r

i've never read this before and i'm now on the verge of tears. thanks so much for linking this.This needs to be posted rather continuously, as a reminder of the great relationship our countries can have if we don't fall for the toxic words and attitude that are trending these days. 
This is a really nice story, and I can appreciate the sacrifices that the good samaritans do, but I really don't like how the OP of that seems to *expect* cars to stop to help others. While it can certainly be helpful beyond words to assist some people, it can also be dangerous and puts the would-be helpers in a very vulnerable situation. Nobody is in the wrong for not stopping to help people they don't know. It would be an outright shame for a naive person to end up hurt or worse. 		To be clear, I'm not trying to dissuade folks from helping others. I just don't want to see it *expected* of others because of the very real possibility of danger involved. And that's why people don't stop. Thoughts like those expressed in your post. I'm not criticising you - you're a product of your society. Those Mexicans were a product of theirs.		I rarely stop to help people myself, but I lived in rural Ireland for a while and caught a flat. After five minutes of starting to change the tire, there was a line of three or four stopped cars beside mine, all trying to help me. 
What, uhm, what was the moral of that story? Death to the bourguesie
What, uhm, what was the moral of that story? That mice are heartless creatures
What, uhm, what was the moral of that story? Kill your enemies before they decide to kill you?
This is such a chip on the shoulder outlook to life. There are absolute dregs of society at all walks of life, all backgrounds, all levels of personal wealth. There are people who have had it hard and will step on someone's head if it gets them 30cm out of hardship. 		Look for the good in people, not assume that because someone was brought up affluent that they won't care for their fellow man. Respect generalisations to protect yourself, but do not let them cloud your judgement of an individual.		The student in this thread, Dominique Harrison-Bentzen, was not poor and she put time and effort into rewarding a kind man.I believe u/AnonTheTerrible was actually referring to the homeless man's initial actions, not to the actions of the student. While both were wonderful actions, his might have come from empathy born of being stuck on the bottom.
Her knees got more range than some actors. But only one knee can do each face so you have to use both for the role, like the Olsen twins.
That's not a thing, it was a joke about an imagined bare minimum of identity security.Ok ok that makes sense. I was thoroughly confused.

Death to the bourguesieLaughed out loud at that comment for some reason... Roll out the guillotines 
Death to the bourguesieThis is not wholesome but my reaction sure was :-) thanks for the laugh friend
Ok ok that makes sense. I was thoroughly confused.Would you say you were... wholesomely confused?
CartilageSkeletal tissue
At least its not OsteoporosisMy skin has Osteo-pore-osis 
Magnets- okay, making magnets, collecting magnets-Just magnets 
Oh wow. Hey, thanks!Another way to look at it is 3=100%, so you have to multiply the 100% by 7,000 to get the percentage (which comes to 700,000%). If you multiply the 3 by 7,000 you get 21,000 (which is the cash amount, not the percentage).
Glad I'm not the only one who butchers stories when re-telling them.Don't forget jokes. I couldn't retell a joke properly if my life depended on it.
Skeletal tissueBone-itis
