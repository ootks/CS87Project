Some men just don't have the guts to tell a girl his feelings, and would much rather have the woman just admit her feelings outright without the stressful courtship.		It's a very common fantasy for men and the "love potion" can be analogous to many other social lubricants such as alcohol. Drinking (for short periods of time, alcoholism is an addiction) doesn't change how someone thinks, only how they act. You're confusing love potion with truth serum. Either of which would be wrong to administer without consent.
Even if the love is not "real", her happiness for being together with the one she thinks she loves will be. So why is it creepy?What about Stockholm Syndrome, where a captor begins to have feelings for their capture after extreme trauma? She's still happy, but that doesn't make it any less creepy and sad.

On one hand, people generally find controlling others' free will to be inherently immoral and creepy.

There's something magical yet creepy about having zero control over something that can change your life.		>Genes and hormones don't give a shit about what you think.		You're looking at it in a wrong way. My opinion is that genes and hormones **ARE** YOU therefore they give you consent for you, they decide who you are attracted to. They are part of you.		You're talking about emotional and/or physical trauma/abuse and that's a whole different story.		Love potion implies that the person using it is someone you aren't generally attracted to (someone fat, ugly etc) therefore your genes and hormones would give forced consent.
When you fall in love with someone, is that even really your choice?Subconsciously, yes. It is the choice of your genes and whatnot since that is who you are.		Love potion is just human manipulation but its pretty much the same sans consent.

Grindelwald, is that you?		As someone with the double whammy of depression and anxiety disorders, sometimes I love to blissfully dream about giving up my free will and putting someone else in charge so I can be happy. I would never do it though. 		And the big issue with someone forcing you to fall in love with them, is that they aren't doing it to make you happy. They're doing it to make *themselves* happy. It's completely selfish, and also indicates a complete lack of respect for the other persons' wishes.

I have to disagree here. Love doesn't mean happiness. Some people are in love knowing that the other one is not good for them. A love potion would have the same effect. It could create love for a person whose actions you might despise. What iff there is a reason you are not in love with them in the first place ? Maybe it just cannot work between the two of you. It doesn't need to be hate, just differents people with differents needs that are incompatible. And there it is, you are in love with someone you might resent, maybe it's a murderer, maybe it's something less serious, but you are stuck in a toxic relationship.

Love doesn't remove concent, it just makes someone develop an attachment for someone else. There's no reason why someone who loves someone else can't say no to anything. Hell, if it's anything like my high school crushes, nothing will happen at all anyways. Changing someone's brain chemistry IS removing their ability to consent.

Haha it's just a comic strip it's not a statement of society or some shit.So? It doesn't belong in this sub.
The moral from this comic is exactly that, to realize that you don't need to drug someone! you learn from the scientist guy's mistake!The comic doesn't portray the attempted drugging as a mistake, though. The scientist guy doesn't suffer any consequences, like the woman telling him "I was into you before, but now that I know you're the kind of person who mind-roofies people, I never want to see you again." Instead, the drugging works out really well for him, because he finds out that she already loves him. Now he can approach her without fear of rejection, and she'll never know what he tried to do to her.
Its about as creepy as Cupids arrow making people fall in love. Jesus man take a chill pill.Well no, it's more like if cupid wasn't the god of love and wasn't necessary for people to fall in love, but just a guy that injected people with mind-control drugs.

Not really, it magically makes them truly love you.  They feel amazing, you feel amazing -- it's magic.   Right, it magically subverts however the other person actually feels. As I've said elsewhere, pick someone you find undesirable. Would you find it cute if they drugged you into loving them?
[removed]Okay. How about Stockholm Syndrome then? 		And the point is that both roofies and love potions take away the victim's free will. 
I don't think people in this thread realize what roofies do.		Hint: It doesn't make the victim fall in love with someone.It takes away consent, just like a love potion would.		People in this thread is just going "love is nice, what's wrong with making people love more". But it seems like they don't get the basic idea of the potion. The only reason you would need it is because the person you want WOULDN'T want to be with you. If they liked you there wouldn't be a need for a potion, so you are actively going against their wishes for your own benefit.		Just imagine the grossest, ugliest and worst person you can and then think about that person slipping you something without your knowledge that made you want to pleasure them forever. Doesn't seem that nice, does it?
A roofie is nothing like a fictional love potion. You are aware what roofies do right?Not very different in the way that matters: subverting someone's autonomy just to make yourself feel good.		And, again, things that don't exist can still be creepy.
No glove, no love. What about snu snu?

What happened to Voldemort about love potions?		Edit- a spellingHis mother fell in love with a muggle, he didn't really care for her, she used a love potion, Voldemort is born 9 months later.
Just saying its better to have loved and lost than not at all right? Some people don't have parents and stuff ya know? Important to cherish memories It is more difficult to have something taken away than not having it in the first place. 		Isn't there a quote like that, with the same meaning but different words?

As someone with the double whammy of depression and anxiety disorders, sometimes I love to blissfully dream about giving up my free will and putting someone else in charge so I can be happy. I would never do it though. 		And the big issue with someone forcing you to fall in love with them, is that they aren't doing it to make you happy. They're doing it to make *themselves* happy. It's completely selfish, and also indicates a complete lack of respect for the other persons' wishes. Well said

Changing someone's brain chemistry IS removing their ability to consent. By your logic do you believe being given hallucinogenic compounds and then asked a question is all ok?In real life? No. In a stick figure web comic? Who gives a shit.
[removed]I don't know why you're being downvoted, what you're saying makes a lot of sense. The love potion trope started off in stories where the writer wanted to write a tormented love affair where it would have been morally wrong if both parties had naturally fallen in love, but the plot demanded it. Like in Tristan and Isolde, where both of them drink a love potion that was supposed to be for Isolde and her intended husband King Mark. At least in that story they both drank it and it was an accident. Having one person affected by a potion is just super creepy.
[removed]I don't understand why this is being downvoted what the fuck? I 100% agree with you on this.
[removed]I'm on your side in this. Love potions are just as bad as slipping someone a roofie. 
Fiction is moral discourse."no but you don't get it, the author made immoral acts look moral in this context, so its still wholesome" 
Well no, it's more like if cupid wasn't the god of love and wasn't necessary for people to fall in love, but just a guy that injected people with mind-control drugs.Oh you've got to be kidding, because its a "god of love" the blatant forced love is suddenly ok? What a fucking joke
Well no, it's more like if cupid wasn't the god of love and wasn't necessary for people to fall in love, but just a guy that injected people with mind-control drugs.Point being this is an absolutely ridiculous point that over analyzes a cutesy comic and ENTIRELY misses the point in doing so.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I didn't think the gun was loaded!"...I mean, yeah that makes it manslaughter instead of murder, which dramatically decreases prison sentence, so yes I wouldn't consider it nearly as bad to accidentally kill someone. Still bad, but intentions make it a lot worse. 		So I suppose in a way I'm saying you're both right, partially.

> As someone with the double whammy of depression and anxiety disorders, sometimes I love to blissfully dream about giving up my free will and putting someone else in charge so I can be happy. I would never do it though.		Do you take medication for your depression and anxiety? In doing so you're modifying your own mental state and way of thinking. That's not far off from a potion that makes you feel happier.		>And the big issue with someone forcing you to fall in love with them, is that they aren't doing it to make you happy. They're doing it to make themselves happy. It's completely selfish,		Correct. But under utilitarianism, people's will doesn't matter, their happiness does. If both people end up happy, regardless of the person's *original wishes*, if they're happier otherwise that is considered the ethical decision.		>and also indicates a complete lack of respect for the other persons' wishes.		The interesting thing here is that the other person's wishes *change* to what you want them to be. Free will only exists to a certain extent. I can make you fall in love with me by looking and acting a certain way and setting off some feelings inside you- and that modifies your mindset and free will; I can make you fall in love with me by spraying you with a love potion, which has the same outcome. And that's the thing about utilitarianism, under that theory the *outcome* is the only thing that matters. You can argue that it's wrong based on other theories, but not utilitarianism. The only real difference here is that it's easier. Kinda reminds me of that one Redditor who read his friend's diary when they were both 16, to learn about ways he could get her to like him. It worked and now they're married and have 3 kids.Taking medication to improve your own mental state of your own free will is vastly different than someone forcing you to behave in a certain way, especially if that behavior is forcing you to fall in love with that person.
Yeah but if you're both blissfully in love forever after, what's the ultimate loss? Furthermore, true altruism doesn't really exist. Everybody does things to further their own interests in one way or another. And I would argue that inherent in hoping to make someone fall in love with you is the fact that once they are in love with you, you will get to make each other happy through your love. Mutual love is beneficial to both parties. So you don't count free will as any sort of loss?
In real life? No. In a stick figure web comic? Who gives a shit.Apparently a lot of people.

I'm on your side in this. Love potions are just as bad as slipping someone a roofie. Right, it's like a Jedi mind trick, or getting a Genie and wishing to read minds and then using what you know to get someone to fall for you. People really need to think rapey roofies when they see these tropes.
Oh you've got to be kidding, because its a "god of love" the blatant forced love is suddenly ok? What a fucking jokeCupid is supposed to represent our minds naturally falling in love with each other; he's an explanation for natural love more than an actual physical being. 		This comic is another human being drugging somebody else into loving him selfishly. You don't see how problems could come from painting that positively?
Point being this is an absolutely ridiculous point that over analyzes a cutesy comic and ENTIRELY misses the point in doing so.Every story is a morality play.
Point being this is an absolutely ridiculous point that over analyzes a cutesy comic and ENTIRELY misses the point in doing so.The point is still "I tried to mind control her into doing what I wanted, but she already wanted it." It's as cutesy as trying to chop someone's limb off, but it turns out they wanted to lose it all along. (As in, it can cause similar amounts of harm to their long-term life/happiness)		It's only cutesy if you're not the one being mind-controlled.
Nope but if I was magically subdued by a genie or a potion I wouldn't give a damn.   		You are failing to suspend your disbelief.   I know what you're saying, you're being waaaaaay too serious.  		All the downvotes whiteknighting for fairy tales... so wholesome :| This has nothing with suspension of disbelief. No one is saying "HEY THAT'S FAKE!", the issue is that this makes it seem cute to take away someone else's free will for your own gain. That's a thing that people actually do, and maybe you're cool with it happening to you (which I doubt), but others aren't.

I'm not going to argue that love potions existing would be a good thing, because it's obvious to anyone with a brain that it wouldn't be due to the reasons you laid out.		However, just because they're both bad does not mean they do the same thing. It takes away consent, sure, but people pointing to roofies as real life examples of love potions are being a bit silly-- it's two different concepts entirely, with only the stripping of consent as a common variable.Right, and that's the commonality that makes people bring it up. No one thinks roofies make you love someone. The point is that stripping consent is bad, and roofies are an example of that.

It's actually a relatively wide belief that Brave New World wouldn't be that bad, so no not necessarily. Like how wide are we talking about?
I think you can certainly make an argument that there is some beauty in sentient beings with free will... but as far as I'm concerned free will just leads to suffering. So it's okay for you to exercise your own free will, but not others?
[removed]Do the mugging jokes paint it as something nice and even wholesome?
[removed]I'm glad you're so tough. You must be the toughest. This isn't a place for requiring people to be tough.
Good thing this potion doesn't work by the same principle as cupid's arrow,  as that would make the whole argument moot.  I mean,  you **obviously** know,  probably from a peer-reviewed article,  that this potion is made from certain chemicals and works like drugs, instead of being made of love,  unicorn hair and piwnic tears collected by a virgin at moonlit hill, and just strengthening the feelings already presentBy definition, it's a potion that forces someone to love you. That's taking control of someone's free will. Cupid is just an explanation for how natural love occurs.
