TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritI like typing wholesomemememes because it's 3 me in a row and that's just fun to type. 
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritI don't always agree with his general attitude or opinion on things, but I hope he beats cancer and has a great Christmas with his family.
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritHey, I'm from r/all. Never seen this sub before. Is it like... r/me_irl but cheery and not depressing?		...I like it. Thanks for existing.
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritI had biscuits and gravy for Christmas this morning and they made me smile I hope you smiled too today :) 
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritWho is total biscuit? 
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritWhat a nice tweet! This sub is rapidly becoming one of my favorite subs - the internet really needs a good upshot of positivity, exactly this kind <3		Thank you all who participate here!
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritWould't be here smiling if he didn't :)
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritHe's my friends neighbor!
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritI just gotta say. I was having a horrible Christmas and I've been browsing this sub and you guys have made me do a 180. Thanks.
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritI hope tb sees this post and feels even more wholesome
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritsome of the comments are just mean. how can you be so mean?
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritI really like this sub. I was getting so tired of the constant flood of memes about depression and suicide, about how much life sucks, how being an adult sucks, how everything sucks. I get that it might help people who suffer from depression when they make stuff like that or read stuff made by others to learn that they aren't the only one who have those thoughts, but the only thing it does for the rest of us is dragging us down.
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritTotalbiscuit is my favorite person in the gaming industry, even if he is not technically part of the industry. 		His commitment to protect the consumer is like the unbreakable spirit of a superhero and I am of full belief that spirit and a healthy dose of british stubborness are what is keeping him alive well past the estimated date of his death.		Seriously, have you ever seen one of his videos when some streamer/game developer pulls a bs trick to cash in on unsuspecting/naive people? He goes from 0 to 100 rage so quickly and absolutely tears them apart. He's as close as you can get to a literal bulwark of protection for the average gamer. 		I hope that we can all learn from TB so even after he sadly passes away we can treat everything we see with skepticism and take care to protect ourselves from malicious exploiters. 
TotalBiscuit with the wholesome Christmas spiritTB making me all teary eyed again ; 3 ;		Also r/wholesomememes you are a super wonderful community 		(><) ::*:,:*:

I don't always agree with his general attitude or opinion on things, but I hope he beats cancer and has a great Christmas with his family.Even if I don't always agree with his opinions I'll always respect him for being so aggressively pro consumer and fighting the video game industry for better treatment of players.

Who is total biscuit? Games journalist - probably one of the most well known youtubers in the PC gaming sector. Often times has controversial opinions but he is well respected for being generally well spoken. 		Unfortunately he has had cancer for a little while though, which has sort of been looming around for a few years so he hasn't been extremely active recently. 
Who is total biscuit? He's a popular British video game Youtuber. I believe he first gained popularity as an e-sports caster for SC2. 
Who is total biscuit? A Youtuber I believe, does a lot of PC gaming if I recall.
Who is total biscuit? A standup guy
He's my friends neighbor!Wow! What a small world! Glad that I can share it with interesting people like you fine folks!!
I just gotta say. I was having a horrible Christmas and I've been browsing this sub and you guys have made me do a 180. Thanks.I stumbled through the doors of r/wholesomememes not too long ago, started with the whole "there's a larger joke at play here, right?", "wait, are they seriously this nice..?", "Oh, why that's just really nice I think I'll upvote that kind person"		It takes a friendly sub like this to show you things can be nice on the internet, and they're just fucking lovely through n through haha
Can I say one thing		Why the hate and these removed comment :,("e-celeb". (no pr guy between him and the public for the longest of times. like have you met the public? we are crazy hard to deal with) has the equivalent for arguments as "resting bitch face" it seems. like i personally don't see it but thats my current best guess. It's like he could say "I don't enjoy meatboy because i'm terrible at 2d platformers" and the internet would go "HE THINKS MEATBOY IS SO BAD YOU SHOULD KILL KITTENS!!!" ... it's weird. dude isn't without his faults but who the fuck is? 
Can I say one thing		Why the hate and these removed comment :,(I haven't read said comments, but I'm guessing that he has opinions, and some people can't live with that. Just like happiness; some people can't live with the happiness of others.
I thought he quit social media. Is he back?Hes like the tide, you see. 
[removed][removed]
Wait, didn't he say he something like he wanted to leave the toxic reddit community forever a while back?		But then again, didn't he say that a couple of times already..?Social media is a hard thing to cut out completely, particularly when you're also trying to stay engaged in an active industry like gaming. The ol' boy is doing what he can.
I don't agree with him generally and sincerely I think it may be a marketing move since most youtubers rely on their online presence but I wish him a merry christmas anyway.I don't think you know him well enough if that's what you think about this

Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. 
Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(I'm not necessarily! Metastatic liver cancer is not often cured (rarely). I have not seen his current updates but as of the 30th of november it has not spread and is shrunk by over 50%. From the size of 5cm to 2cm. We can still hold faith. Metastatic cancer is tough to beat but it isnt impossible. He is a strong man, a stubborn man. I he has a chance to beat it. My grandfather had pancreatic cancer (a 92.3% mortality rate) and beat it. He did pass later however due to old age and a weakened immune system due to the chemo and radiation therapy. tb is young and has a fighting chance. 
Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(Maybe he will be the first!
Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(I thought that his treatments were shrinking the tumor?
Sadly he can't, it's terminal :(When did this happen? Thought it was like 30% survival but the majority of people who got this cancer are like 80+ so his chances are way better, beyond that I thought it was in remission
TIL Totalbiscuit has cancer.Yup, for almost a year, maybe longer. 
[removed][deleted]
[removed]You mean the charity stream that he tried to help by linking it on twitter and the person running the stream decided that TB putting out a link was tantamount to ruining everything do he shut down the stream in a hissy fit instead if jusy letting TBs followers help the charity?
[removed]I was about to write something snarky but then I remembered where I am so let me just say this:    	If we are talking about the incident all he did was retweet the stream link to give it exposure. I don't really see how that ruins a stream.
Weirdly, I see /r/me_irl as positive - it's like people realise they aren't quite cutting it, but are willing to take the piss out of themselves."life fucking sucks but at least we can laugh at it and keep going"
Weirdly, I see /r/me_irl as positive - it's like people realise they aren't quite cutting it, but are willing to take the piss out of themselves.I think this place has been rubbing off on reddit. Either that or it is a general trend of positivity on reddit. It might just be that Reddit is getting less mean after election season. But I kind of doubt it as I still see politics everywhere and even when I agree with the jerk politics right now is toxic. Regardless this sub is doing good work.

He's a gaming critic.

We know for two years now.Well two years i havent seen a video of his nor read his twitter. It happens. I love the man but i just fell out of loop. I stopped watching youtube late 2013 and only started watching it again regularly again about 6 months ago as i found more free time to do so dropping a second job.

Genna also found out she has some sort of uterine tumor, IIRC Damn, didn't there kid have a tumor too? Seriously bad luck for those guys hoped they pull through
According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.
According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. [deleted]
According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. Maybe he can keep his luck up :D
According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. >According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago.		This is simply not true. He was given a ~3 year prognosis upon discovering the metastasis less than 3 years ago. That is not "should have been dead a long time ago."		He's shared some positive developments since then, but nothing at the level of a Christmas miracle like you describe.		**EDIT:** correction - he never actually revealed any prognosis - ~3 years is just the average lifespan for those diagnosed with his condition. It's really unfortunate, but liver metastasis is still basically a death sentence, even in 2016 :(		Of course, we're *all* technically terminal anyway... It should also be noted that most people who are diagnosed with liver metastasis are much, *much* older than TB. His youth definitely doesn't hurt his chances, but it's still an incredibly awful illness.		I'd also like to point out that we all ought to learn from this. TB confessed that he had had bloody stool for several months before he actually went and got it checked out. Had he gone immediately, who knows what would've happened. Moral of the story is, if your body is doing something really weird/bad, **get it checked out**. 
According to doctors he should've been dead a long time ago. It's hard to tell- his variety of cancer primarily afflicts people who are much older, so it's very hard to know how bad it will affect him

"life fucking sucks but at least we can laugh at it and keep going":)		Most positive look at meirl I've seen. I always saw this sub as the natural response to meirl's excessive depression memes.

But I kind of doubt it as I still see politics everywhere and even when I agree with the jerk politics right now is toxic. Regardless this sub is doing good work.True.  		I am a perfect example... 		I just saw some idiot trolling about politics on Twitter and thought about taking the bait and even had my reply typed out, but deleted it, closed the window, and came here instead.  	I came back to 4 positive messages.  		It appears people are bored to hell with shitting on each other, and what's the point? It has no real effect - just increases blood pressure levels.

Nope, he started with wow pvp videos, and then moved to sc2.Oh yeah, he did some stuff with the Yogscast way back when.
There's a different subset of people that hate him for joining in on the Gamergate nonsense. Telling his twitter followers to harass MovieBob, saying that fiction should never have politics in it, bloviating endlessly about hating Antia Sarkeesian and victim blaming her when she received credible death threats, etc. 		edit: I don't play the same types of games as TB so I only hear about him when he's being a shitheel. He could be as pure as Mr. Rogers outside of that for all I know. i recognise the events you are referring to but your interpretation leaves me so dumbfounded i dunno what to reply. like a "just dispassionately try to look at those things again while assuming straight up good intentions or atleast no malice on his part as a thought experiment" is the only thing i can come up with that'll be in the spirit of this sub. Like i honestly just don't understand your perspective. i'm most cerainly biased but if you want to get into a good natured argument about specifics feel free to pm me since this sub isn't really about that.
Why are you replying to your own comment?I make great conversation :)
Glad everyone is enjoying it. :) Indeed so ty kindly.
What does that extra Me stand for?It's a typo.
You're naive if you think gamers aren't treated like shit by many publishers and developers Don't lose sight of wholesomeness guys : )

TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.Cancer doesn't have a high enough FOV setting to kill TB. 
TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.TB's so ~~stubborn~~ committed to living a full and happy life that he won't let even cancer keep him down.
TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.His cancer is only 30fps, it isn't fast enough to kill him.		Well, if it was on a screen, watching it in 30fps would.
TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.So cynical, even the cancer isn't sure if it exists. 
TB's so stubborn that he won't even let cancer keep him down.He got cancer, but he dropped it.
it's colon cancer, not liver. not the same prognosis... sadly.The colon cancer went into remission i think? his new tumor is metastatic located in the liver iirc (metastatic is reallllllly rough anywhere. Particularly in the liver). Colon cancer has a fairly good survival rate when it comes to hope. Liver however isnt as good but it still is better than say, pancreatic cancer at a low 8% chance of survival due to an incredibly low detection rate. The biggest thing is stages. I'm not sure how long it took to detect his colon cancer but i know the metastatic growth was detected quick but those things grow QUICK. As previously said from what i could find, the end of november held news of the good sort. I went from devistated hearing of this for the first time today to trying to find all i can about his status. I'm not saying he'll be the one to beat it to hell but his current status could prove to keep him going for at least a while longer. When he was diagnosed he was given 2-3 years. Not sure if that changed. 		And colon cancer is far more curable than liver cancers. 		I honestly would cry myself to sleep for weeks knowing my life was given 3 years shelf life. I cant imagine the pain he feels, the emotions he suffers through. He is a good man in my opinion. Of course i'm being optimistic but a man can have hope. 
they are. he is now able to fight the cancer because the cancer mutated into a form of cancer that is actually treatable		https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/779352262997139456Better luck mutating next time, cancer.

I came back to 4 positive messages.  		It appears people are bored to hell with shitting on each other, and what's the point?

Be it shopping, or driving or reading comments/posts. It's not always easy, but I always feel better for it, even if it takes me a bit to realize it. 
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad He recently cited how CODs new single player is far better than BF1, and how COD is getting unfair shit for doing the same stuff over and over while they've been innovating and BF1 is pretty much just a reskin of BF4, which upset a lot of people. He didn't say Infinite warfare is good, which a lot of people took it as, just that he thought it was stupid how much praise  BF was getting. 		That's just one of the things, but it's all similar.
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad I'm guessing his various opinions on games, etc. Nothing too controversial. Unless you happen to be fan of said game, the Titanfall 2 Single-Player springs to mind. 
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad I'm not the one you asked but over the last year+ I have watched his videos not much controversial came up. Maybe only a thing about the presidential election, trump and stuff. 
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad Personally my only disagreements with his opinions have been about game play occasionally he'll dislike something I enjoy in a game or vice versa, but I know a lot of people disagreed with his opinions an "gamer-gate" and that's the biggest controversy I can think of off the top of my head. 
Could I ask what some of his opinions you disagree with? I haven't been on the channel in a year and a half and I just wanna make sure he Hasn't gone mad TB doesn't mind cosmetic micro transactions that are available at launch. He doesn't defend them but he says they are fine. I personally disagree with that. He defended overwatches progression system. 		Thats about it for me. Still a very sane man and he is still objective so I don't have to give a shit what he thinks, he informs me and I know what to think. 
Oh yeah, he did some stuff with the Yogscast way back when.He is the person who got the yogscast started lmao
It's a typo.Its just a happy little mistake :)
Don't lose sight of wholesomeness guys : )I'm trying. Might have to move the argument to pms:p
He did, but Orion is apparently quite fine.i like that name
Do they collect uranium or something? Why the fuck are they all getting tumors and cancer?His job is on the internet. That's usually a good source of the latter.

Jesus, how many people have this horrible disease...My aunt just passed away from it. Cancer is very common, sadly. Someone you know will be afflicted by it in your life before you're 30, unfortunately.		The thing with bowel cancer (and most internal cancers of the digestive tract) is that they aren't as glamourous to market awareness.		Even testicular cancer is hard to raise awareness.		Breast cancer is easy to market awareness to both sexes, and even cervical cancer is easy to raise awareness (because most women go to an OB/GYN.)		Colon cancer, rectal cancer, etc. is hard to market merchandise concerning at.		"Feel your Boobies" is easy.		"Get a Barium enema and an x-ray" is hard. 
Better luck mutating next time, cancer.YouTube commenter here, my bad.
This is so true. Every time something negative occurs, I've been working very hard not to have that instant knee jerk reaction. Be it shopping, or driving or reading comments/posts. It's not always easy, but I always feel better for it, even if it takes me a bit to realize it. I've definitely noticed improvement in my attitude and general well-being since I'm visiting this sub and see other hate-filled subreddits in another light. 		I think we all slowly got used to that daily negative kind of feedback in our social media feeds that we didn't notice how it slowly took over our lives, emotions and feelings, and it certainly does take a while to see a newly adapted mindset take it's effect on you. I like to imagine it as a tree. You plant the seed and give it water every day, and with every minute you care for it it will keep growing stronger and healthier. And before you know it you end up with a big, beautiful tree. 		I think it's perfectly normal to have reactions like those, but it's so much more enjoyable to look at life with a positive outlook. 		That said, I wish you a merry x-mas and a (early) happy new year friend :^) Take care! 
He recently cited how CODs new single player is far better than BF1, and how COD is getting unfair shit for doing the same stuff over and over while they've been innovating and BF1 is pretty much just a reskin of BF4, which upset a lot of people. He didn't say Infinite warfare is good, which a lot of people took it as, just that he thought it was stupid how much praise  BF was getting. 		That's just one of the things, but it's all similar.Oh ok I just wanted to make sure he wasent saying anything bat shit crazy while I was gone
I'm guessing his various opinions on games, etc. Nothing too controversial. Unless you happen to be fan of said game, the Titanfall 2 Single-Player springs to mind. people are always butthurt if someone doesn't like the game/movie/music they like, people who make these things part of personality that is and don't realize that these things are subjective.	
I'm not the one you asked but over the last year+ I have watched his videos not much controversial came up. Maybe only a thing about the presidential election, trump and stuff. Is he Pro Trump or anti Trump? I have stopped following him since a year or so.
TB doesn't mind cosmetic micro transactions that are available at launch. He doesn't defend them but he says they are fine. I personally disagree with that. He defended overwatches progression system. 		Thats about it for me. Still a very sane man and he is still objective so I don't have to give a shit what he thinks, he informs me and I know what to think. the overwatch cosmetic discussion is an interesting one, I don't disagree with either wide but lean towards it being ok just because I have most skins I want at level 102, game was 33% cheaper than most triple A titles, and game is getting free content updates
Its just a happy little mistake :)A happy...me-stake.
Cancer is the true peasant.And thusly the secret is found as to why cancer will never beat TB.
Nah, he has Heart, CranK, Alicia, and Ryung 4v1ing cancer. Its the real reason Axiom was disbanded.Cancer's got strong micro but the macro just aint there
Surely you mean it doesn't have a low enough FoV? Higher FOV = able to see more on-screen		Cancer can't see TB
And he won't, back down.Flashbacks to Barnyard. Great movie.
And he won't, back down.THERES TOO MUCH AT STAKE
And he won't, back down.You can stand him up at the gates of hell, but he won't back down.
> everyone on reddit is an oncologist now ?		> isn't an oncologistThere is so little self awareness in his post I can't even handle it
Is he Pro Trump or anti Trump? I have stopped following him since a year or so.Very anti-Trump		https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/5c0iza/totalbiscuit_quits_reddit_citing_trumps_intent_to/
Is he Pro Trump or anti Trump? I have stopped following him since a year or so.Anti Trump, pretty strongly. I wasn't watching at the moment, but I think he had a big out-burst about it online, he chilled out apparently and I think he apologized, and to be fair - as an immigrant to the United States who has cancer; a President who's probably going to have an impact on healthcare in the US isn't the best thing to have happen. But there's a load of specifics there I don't know about and would rather not get into - I just hope everything turns out OK for everyone involved.
Is he Pro Trump or anti Trump? I have stopped following him since a year or so.not American or Russian so statistically speaking anti-Trump
Is he Pro Trump or anti Trump? I have stopped following him since a year or so.[removed]
Was the Yogscast not a WoW guild originally in which Simon and Lewis made all of the videos?They might have been in TB's guild, but I'm pretty sure tb got them started on youtube and into the tgs network
Higher FOV = able to see more on-screen		Cancer can't see TBI guess so, I was trying to hint at low FoV being bad but that works
You can stand him up at the gates of hell, but he won't back down.He will, stand. His. Ground. And he, wont, back down
not American or Russian so statistically speaking anti-TrumpStatistically speaking most Americans are anti trump.

I guess so, I was trying to hint at low FoV being bad but that worksOhh right I didn't even think of that
Makes sense but each and everything is deleted or removed now. I wanted to see TB's perspective. I believe this was his last post on the matter	https://www.twitch.tv/totalbiscuit/p/126163861478820597
Not really.I know this isn't the place for it but, statistically speaking, yeah. He lost the popular vote and is entering his presidency with the lowest approval rating of anyone. So, statistically and factually speaking...yeah.
