>Picture of myself in fifty years.		Selfie sticks can time travel?		Edit: Such a lack of chill at a simple joke. Holy shit.Jeez reddit didn't like this one. I laughed anyway. 
So like he must have taken a really good pic of himself when he was 30 or something?I would say that estimate was about right yeah, and it's good he's taken another really good one too, hope he takes many more 
[removed]Hey friend! This is /r/wholesomememes, try to be a bit more optimistic! Maybe he enjoys exploring nature on his own. Heck, I bet he has a loving cohort of family and friends at home, and sometimes it can be relaxing to get away from it all and have some me-time alone!
[removed]Stop being a negative nancy. People can take selfies whenever, he's probably with people he might just want a selfie of himself.
[removed]Maybe he enjoys going on hikes by himself?  I know I do and trust me it's not sad.

Leaves from the vine 			Falling so slow That scene does cause sadness, but it also shows how much Iroh loved his son, and it reminds me about how much I love my own family. Sometimes a little sadness is a good thing. It helps us remember what we care about and value!
