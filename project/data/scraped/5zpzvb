Good on you, grandma!*SHOTS*, *SHOTS*, *SHOTS*		go grandma
Good on you, grandma!Most people wouldn't think about going out with their grandma to a pool party to get hammered and pick up girls.			But one thing many don't realize is your grandma is possibly the best wingman you will ever have. I am not joking at all. Hear me out.			1) First off, she doesn't give a fuck. She probably saw a war or two in her time and to her life is as precious as it is short. She will walk up to the crowd of the hottest girls by the pool, I am talking the girls you wouldn't dream of having the balls to talk to, and she will make sure they know who you are.				2) Now the hottest girls know who you are. She is pointing you out and you are a tad embarrassed. Well don't be. Fucking grandma will talk you up in a way women not only understand but highly appreciate. She isn't your best bud who is far too drunk and just tells them how nice and honest you are and how they should give you a chance, she is speaking in fucking women-tongue and they will be interested to talk to you regardless of what you look like or how shy you are.				3) She WANTS you to get laid. She wants you to find the hottest fucking most gorgeous girl around the pool/pub/bar/whatever because she wants her genes to be not only passed on, but passed UP the genetic lottery chain. She will do everything in her power to make sure her perfect little grandson is seeing a girl she is incredibly proud to say is now her granddaughter in law. She WANTS YOU TO GET LAID.				4) Women love a big and close family. My dad is a piece of shit but the reason my mom initially was attracted to him is because he appeared to have a very large and loving family. A family where the grandparents are always happy when you call and have nothing bad to say about you. This right here is a huge bonus to getting the gorgeous girl sunbathing across the pool to be interested in talking to you.				5) Grandma will never let a situation get dry. You are taking shots with grandma and 3 of the hottest girls you have ever seen all wearing a bikinis, likely never been in this situation and are kind of shy and don't know how to act. Well your grandma has you fucking covered. Situation grows silent, she will say something like "Do you want to hear the story of how my little Bizarrosparks when he was 5 asked out his teacher in kindergarten?" She will never let the conversation go dry because she doesn't give a fuck, she loves you to death, she wants you to succeed. And even if you don't, she believes you deserve to be with the most beautiful woman on the planet and will do everything in her power to make sure it happens.					Love you, grandma!

Good on you, grandma!That's nice and all but they don't look like shots to me.		Edit: a word
Good on you, grandma!Which one is the grandma? They all look great.
Good on you, grandma!Maybe it was the girls style in bathing suit that drew her in like a moth to a flaming shot of 151.
Good on you, grandma!Those swimsuits look super uncomfortable. I'm afraid if I wore something like that my boobs would pop out.
Good on you, grandma! If Grandma had a matching swimsuit, what would it say? Go. 
Good on you, grandma!My grandmother can't drink without getting 'woozy' but I'll be fucked if she isn't the best damned hustler I've ever seen. Don't underestimate the 85 year old woman who sits down at the tables.

[removed]I have a feeling that would work in Ireland tbh. Irish girls are super attractive too.
Wow, I was really expecting some copypasta here.		subbed /r/wholesomememes Welcome to the party! We all love each other here at /r/wholesomemes. Also, /u/BizarroSparkS is absolutely right about all this. BUT, he left out on of the most important points! And that is:		6) These beautiful girls are going to find your relationship with your grandma absolutely endearing, sweet, and wonderful! Most women appreciate (and sometimes seek out) family-oriented guys. And if a group of girls sees a guy poolside with his grandma, as opposed to his drunk buddies, they will see a guy who loves spending time with grandma more than having the more typical "young people fun". And that, my friends, is the type of guy they'll (probably) want to bring around their families!		Trust me, this works! I was on a date once where my grandma called me to chat. I told my date I had to take the call, because I NEVER ignore my grandparents. So i'm sitting on the phone with my grandma for 5 minutes, chatting, as I help her figure out what channel Supercross was on (my grandma is fucking awesome). So I'm Googling around for her, and talking on speaker phone. And, as always, I ended the call by telling my grandma that I loved her. (Always tell your grandma you love her!!!!)		My date later said that it was the most adorable thing she'd ever seen, and that it apparently made me 5 times more attractive. All because I took the time to talk to my grandma, and told her I loved her. (None of which was for show, obviously. That's how I always talk to my grandma.)
That subtle, "my dad's a piece of shit" in there. Don't know whether to laugh or cry. He sent me to get a paternity test when I was a young toddler because he didn't want to believe I was his. Then moved to a different country to avoid child support. Last I saw his Facebook said he had one son. It wasn't my name.
Dude......No idea what you are trying to imply here.
Unfortunately I don't have any grandmas left [deleted]
I definitely want to be this kind of grandma, but I'm afraid my son would disown me as his father if I did. Yea it sucks when your son won't be your father anymore.
I definitely want to be this kind of grandma, but I'm afraid my son would disown me as his father if I did. Solution: be your own Grandma.
A cursory Google search shows Scoop Back One Piece swimsuit. However I heard being wrong on the internet is a good way of getting the right answer. So let's hope someone corrects me or helps my claim. I think it's just like a high cut one piece swimsuit. there's probably a scoop back too
'whoops, my boob popped out while I was swimming' swimsuits 		Seriously... I wouldn't wear one, and I'm not saying that because I'm a guy (not that guys can't wear swimsuits), I'm saying that because I'm a girl. I think they're meant for smaller boobs anyway.

I don't know what they're called, but they look straight out of the 80s with the super high hip holes. Hopefully women's hairstyles don't go back to the 80s too, or the ozone layer might be done for.I'm personally quite fine with these one pieces

Powder kegWow, did not expect a funny WWI reference. Thanks for the laugh (both of you)

No idea what you are trying to imply here.I mean... just... bro.
You're a horse woman.99 of them, actually
I honestly thought that was the point, it's just so obvious that'll happenExactly the reason I wouldn't wear one. I have no issue in others seeing my body. Just don't want them to see my bare boobs.		The butt part of it seems very uncomfortable as well. I would expect it to slide in my asscrack as soon as I put it on. I do have some nice cushioning back there though. So it might just be me. 
Those are limes. They're drinking tequila.Oh! Those are some huuuge shots then.		Grandma is like "a double is for chimps. Let's do a quad!" 		Edit: was supposed to be "chumps". I'm leaving it.
that would make sense, I guess. Frat Mat
Your friend must be very nervous around them because his face is pretty redBOY IS MY FACE RED
it's ok, i know they look good.  		also, the black swim suit says 		FRAT STAR		edit: wait, if i said i didn't believe you, would you post more proof?  cause thats good proof.Faf

Those bathing suits look too small and uncomfortable. I'm not a lady but that's what I thought. Like it would hurt your crotch and butt area. Probably dig in other places too. Do they squish your boobs? Does Boob squishing hurt?

Those bathing suits look too small and uncomfortable. They're straight out of 1983, dunno what the problem is.

Damnit, this doesn't help solve what the third bathing suit says. Will I ever know?		EDIT: scrolled further down. I have my answer. Frat Star
I'm 25 and every time I go to do something with my grandfather we end up dressed almost exactly the same...I dress like a 70 year old man and idk how to feel about itMaybe that just means your grandpa dresses young :) 
Next thing you know people will start claiming old people used to be young people!DISCUSTING

I mean... just... bro.Is this a good bro or a bad bro? XD Maybe my grandma is just the coolest grandma on the planet.
I do fit the bill, but I'm not to keen on the underground granny trade.... Well you're awfully high and mighty, Rapejelly. 
99 of them, actuallyOr an 18 year old horse woman...which is better?

Faf wearing anything that says fratstar as a guy nf
I'm not a lady but that's what I thought. Like it would hurt your crotch and butt area. Probably dig in other places too. Do they squish your boobs? Does Boob squishing hurt?Yes, boob squishing hurts and is no fun.		Looking hot on the beach and taking shots with random grandmas is pretty fun tho.

Does Boob squishing hurt?No, not really in a bathing suit. I'm sure if it was like a tight chest binder then yeah.		Edit: can't speak for all women. Never had this problem personally.

It's funny how the photo gives the impression of a glamorous/fun life, but this video shows how mundane and normal the interaction was.you've just described most social media. a whole lot of pretending and faking to keep up appearances
It's funny how the photo gives the impression of a glamorous/fun life, but this video shows how mundane and normal the interaction was.I went to a spring break beach like this during college and it's a weird mix between every Spring Break Beach scene you see in movies (women flashing, bros shouting, people doing stupid stunts like climbing balconies for shots) and typical awkward college parties where everyone just drinks and stands around and has awkward meaningless drunk conversations on their way to sit with their friends. Basically college parties with sand. Anakins hate it.
Maybe that just means your grandpa dresses young :) For some reason I presumed u/mhassig is a woman and was briefly very confused by both of the above comments...		*imagines grandpa in ripped hot pants and translucent blouse*

Or an 18 year old horse woman...which is better?I guess that begs the question.  If you're trapped on a desert island with only an 18 year old horse woman, which half would you prefer to be a horse?

You get to take a drink from the fire hose!The classic but unappreciated UHF comment. I love it.
wearing anything that says fratstar as a guy nfI think it's perfect irony. A girl wearing it is frat af, a guy wearing it is a sure sign he's an NF GDI PCF

I went to a spring break beach like this during college and it's a weird mix between every Spring Break Beach scene you see in movies (women flashing, bros shouting, people doing stupid stunts like climbing balconies for shots) and typical awkward college parties where everyone just drinks and stands around and has awkward meaningless drunk conversations on their way to sit with their friends. Basically college parties with sand. Anakins hate it.Summer 2003, 17 years old, I went to Padre Island with my best friend and my dad. Had my first beer and decided it was a lot of fun. So the 2nd day I drew "party here" in the sand and hung out there all day. By the end of the night we had 20-30 strangers partying with us. Met some people who gave me beer, another guy invited us to his birthday party at a cabin behind us the following night, and 5 girls challenged me to remember all their names.		The next day we go to the house party. There's a naked girl skate boarding on the porch while a punk band plays. A girl pulled me into the laundry room and asked,"what do you want?" and one drunk guy fell off the balcony, twice. 		I got too drunk, told laundry girl no, and ran downstairs to vomit for my first time of alcohol abuse. My dad helped me to the tent where the 5 girls were just walking up, I recited their names then immediately passed out. My friend was at the party until 4, where naked skateboard girl let him drive her car even though he didn't have a license. He got mad at her and threw her car keys into the ocean.		Nothing ever that cool has ever happened again.
Such is party life.		In 20 years the fun will have worn off and some of them will be old saleswomen who can't close, and unhappy alcoholic spouses and mothers.		In some cases they'll gravitate toward trailer parks.  In others, jail.		The rest will be happy and successful, but mainly because they grew out of the lifestyle.You know, some people lead happy and successful lives, go to school/have a career and enjoy partying on their vacations and/or weekends. It's not automatically the trashy lifestyle you described (although it can be for some).
For some reason I presumed u/mhassig is a woman and was briefly very confused by both of the above comments...		*imagines grandpa in ripped hot pants and translucent blouse*My mom named me Morgan, I never stood a chance.

I guess that begs the question.  If you're trapped on a desert island with only an 18 year old horse woman, which half would you prefer to be a horse?Whichever half makes her happier. It's the horse woman's body, after all, not mine.
I guess that begs the question.  If you're trapped on a desert island with only an 18 year old horse woman, which half would you prefer to be a horse?I think having a human to talk to and another set of hands to help with survival would be invaluable. 		As far as the back horse-half goes, my father once told me everyone is pink on the inside
