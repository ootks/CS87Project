I love when celebrities are starstruckme when the OP of a /r/wholesomememes post replies to my comment
I love when celebrities are starstruckI actually saw Aaron Paul at a concert I went to. He was roped off in a VIP section a few feet away. He was super into it and my favorite part of the night was when I saw him standing up dancing and then heard him yell "I fucking love you!" Just totally fan-girling out like the rest of us. Seems like a super down to earth dude. 
I love when celebrities are starstruckThat's cute 
I love when celebrities are starstruckBo Burnham is, in my opinion, a very funny person and one of my favorite solo artists. He has two specials on Netflix, 'What.' (Which is also available to watch for free on Youtube) and 'Make Happy'. He also has several other albums on iTunes/Google Play that I recommend listening to. :)
I love when celebrities are starstruckMake Happy seriously changed my outlook on life. Aaron isn't exaggerating, it's really that good. Cool to see to of my favorite celebs being bros. 
I love when celebrities are starstruckCan Aaron Paul please get Bo Burnham an intro to the BoJack writing staff? I'd love to see a Bo Burnham inspired musical episode of BoJack Horseman. And I genuinely hate musicals.

I remember watching him, and showing him to my sister. 		It's one of the best things that really helped me cope with my loss. I still remember sitting in my sister's bedroom smoking, just blinded by the loss but brought up by something so smart, so genuine and for that to last for DECADE?!		Who knows where he will go. I loved him in parks, too. He's s badass. 
Make Happy seriously changed my outlook on life. Aaron isn't exaggerating, it's really that good. Cool to see to of my favorite celebs being bros. I'm just super easily emotionally influenced, and I downloaded Make Happy from Netflix to watch during a flight. I felt really sad after it because I was just thinking about how sad he was and how the issues he mentioned are so personal to him. After that I rewatched certain parts of the performance and it just became a really wholesome performance for me. Like it's real, emotional, funny, relatable, and I could even learn from it!		Make Happy didn't make me happy, it made me a more complete person.
Can Aaron Paul please get Bo Burnham an intro to the BoJack writing staff? I'd love to see a Bo Burnham inspired musical episode of BoJack Horseman. And I genuinely hate musicals.maybe todd could have another shot at his rock opera?

I really really hope they hang out after this and get all weird and giggly with each other the way fans get with them.Pssssst! Hey!.... This was three years ago.... I don't know if they hung out after but I've been imagining they have been. Like... best friends.

Aw:) who is Aaron Paul?		*EDIT*: TIL Aaron Paul has done a lot of cool stuff!The voice of Nyx from the Final Fantasy XV movie
Which one is the celebrity?Both are, Aaron Paul is an actor who got a lot of recognition when he played Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad. Bo Burnham is a stand-up comedian and singer/songwriter, with the two roles often overlapping. He has a couple stand-up specials on Netflix, most recently ~~"What"~~ "Make Happy" and also "What", which is the special Aaron Paul is referring to :) 
woah, cool. 		^^ that's all I had to add.You're cool, thanks for your addition.
Who's Aaron Paul?Jesse bitch.  	  	Edit: In all seriousness he played Jesse Pinkman, Walter White's assistant in crime on Breaking Bad. His character is known for being profane and saying "bitch" a lot. 
[removed]I may not agree with you, but I appreciate your opinion! :) 
[removed]/r/happycringeworthy maybe?

True ;)I love you
What's a whole so me meme?hole so may maymay? idk. But something good, undoubtedly!
Who was performing?Jack Garratt. Really talented artist, would highly recommend!
You're cute :)Both of you are really cute. You guys should consider dating <3
"What." is probably the best stand-up special I've ever seen. The cinematography is outstanding. I'm so impressed by it. I don't even compare it to "stand-up." 		That shit is an amazing hour long preformance, a one-man show.
"What." is probably the best stand-up special I've ever seen. The cinematography is outstanding. I'm so impressed by it. Man, have you seen his original "Words, Words, Words" show?		That. Was. Fucking. Incredible.		Legitimately groundbreaking.		"What." is okay. Actually its very enjoyable. But it doesn't compare with the magic of the original :(

I'm so impressed by it. 		definitely. one thing really great imo is that he does references to earlier bits but doesn't overdo it		even if the show was sponsored by pringles i'd be fine with that
I love Make Happy and What. I like to listen to his songs a lot too, they're really creative :)I really appreciated the finale of Make Happy more when I heard it helped him overcome his anxiety and stuff when he performs
I love Make Happy and What. I like to listen to his songs a lot too, they're really creative :)I found Make Happy to be very depressing, but a great piece of work. I absolutely loved it. 
I love Make Happy and What. I like to listen to his songs a lot too, they're really creative :)No one can quite go from insane hilarity to getting real with the feels like Bo. 		The wide range of emotions I feel watching his specials is insane and unlike any other comedy special I've ever seen. 		It's insane how good he is for such a young age. I think he knows how to handle himself properly like an experience comic but understands the humour young people look for because of his age. 
Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous is still one of my favorite shows. So many laugh out loud moments.Bo got screwed. He was on MTV at a weird point and everyone started transitioning to Netflix / cable cutting. 
[Not everything is very wholesome tho](https://youtu.be/ByC8sRdL-Ro)Nah, that song's true message, which is "Don't listen to celebrities who tell you what to do. Only you can be you.", is very wholesome. It's just presented in an unwholesome manner.
maybe todd could have another shot at his rock opera? I would watch a Bo Burnham written, Aaron Paul performed rock opera on it's own. Pairing it alongside Bojack's animating team would probably destroy all other comedy and sci Fi for me.
I like you, pal.I like you too, friend.

The actor who plays Jesse in Breaking Bad. Voice actor of Todd on BoJack Horseman.
The actor who plays Jesse in Breaking Bad. And the star of The Path on Hulu!
The actor who plays Jesse in Breaking Bad. At first I thought OP put a black bar across Aaron's face and I was like why do you need to censor his face when his name still shows up and he's a celebrity. I'm so dumb haha
The voice actor for Todd in BoJack Horsemanthe cutie
The voice of Nyx from the Final Fantasy XV movieThe movie is basically a two hour fight scene - and he managed to make his character very likeable.		Not an easy feat!
I may not agree with you, but I appreciate your opinion! :) This is the best sub on Reddit.   :)
I love you<3
I love youI know.
I love youMe too thanks
Jack Garratt. Really talented artist, would highly recommend!Love Jack Garratt!
Jack Garratt. Really talented artist, would highly recommend!Saw him at Norwich this year, he kept on cracking jokes between songs, seems like a really genuine and funny guy 
Bo Burnham. Try to keep up. Not very wholesome of you. 
Both of you are really cute. You guys should consider dating <3/u/SilverSandwiches would you ... uhm.. maybe... consider...		Would you like to go out with me?
I don't even compare it to "stand-up." 		That shit is an amazing hour long preformance, a one-man show.Fuck. Guess I'm getting high and watching this shit again. For the hundredth time. Dammit why does he have to be so fucking funny. 
I don't even compare it to "stand-up." 		That shit is an amazing hour long preformance, a one-man show.That's because it's more akin to an established different sort of comedy that is very popular in my country (the Netherlands). It is called cabaret and one of the most well-known performers of the genre in my country (Hans Teeuwen) has actually been mentioned over and over again by Bo Burnham as one of his influences.		I really would go as far as to say it isn't stand-up, it definitely isn't from my point of view because he does almost exactly what a lot of cabaret performers have been doing in my country for at least the past 2-3 decades. Though Bo certainly injects his American 2016 stand-up flavour into the mix.		I love Bo greatly for that, for finally introducing the states to it. And because his shows are just great ofcourse :)		
Man, have you seen his original "Words, Words, Words" show?		That. Was. Fucking. Incredible.		Legitimately groundbreaking.		"What." is okay. Actually its very enjoyable. But it doesn't compare with the magic of the original :(Is it worth watching the original after watching What.?
Man, have you seen his original "Words, Words, Words" show?		That. Was. Fucking. Incredible.		Legitimately groundbreaking.		"What." is okay. Actually its very enjoyable. But it doesn't compare with the magic of the original :(My favorite show so far is definitely "Make Happy" 
I really appreciated the finale of Make Happy more when I heard it helped him overcome his anxiety and stuff when he performsIt's one of my most favorite pieces of art ever. Few things made me think and feel and hurt and laugh and relate so intensely as it did. 
I really appreciated the finale of Make Happy more when I heard it helped him overcome his anxiety and stuff when he performsAgreed, that is the only ending to a comedy performance that I've ever seen that isn't supposed to be funny. It's really well done and introspective. Really gives you insight into Bo as a human being and not just a guy telling jokes. 
I found Make Happy to be very depressing, but a great piece of work. I absolutely loved it. That show made me feel all sorts of feelings I wasn't expecting. It was this weird sort of sad insight into his emotions while still obviously being guarded because it was a performance but still at the same time ahhhh!		In the end though, it did make me happy. Thanks, Bo. I hope you're happy too.
I like you too, friend.I am your friend, buddy. 
Voice actor of Todd on BoJack Horseman.Ohhh *that's* why Todd reminds me so much of Jesse
Voice actor of Todd on BoJack Horseman.He IS
And the star of The Path on Hulu!Worth watching?
At first I thought OP put a black bar across Aaron's face and I was like why do you need to censor his face when his name still shows up and he's a celebrity. I'm so dumb hahaYou're not dumb. You're perfect. :)
I believe "Make Happy" is the most recent, but I'm not sure. Oh whoops, you're right 
<3Any room for one more? :)
Me too thanksnot OP, but <3
Not very wholesome of you. He used a smiley though ;)
/u/SilverSandwiches would you ... uhm.. maybe... consider...		Would you like to go out with me?Absolutely!
/u/SilverSandwiches would you ... uhm.. maybe... consider...		Would you like to go out with me?/u/steviewonderphd I would! If you asked me 10 years  earlier... but you sure are swell !
Fuck. Guess I'm getting high and watching this shit again. For the hundredth time. Dammit why does he have to be so fucking funny. My girlfriend listens to What or Make Happy Every morning while she gets ready, I have them memorized just by proxy.
Fuck. Guess I'm getting high and watching this shit again. For the hundredth time. Dammit why does he have to be so fucking funny. Thanks, me too
Yeah, I came back to say this as I just finished watching it.  It's definitely not the best stand up comedy I've ever seen.  I hardly laughed, the audience never really fell apart with laughter.  There's a few chuckles here and there with a bunch of cheering and clapping from a supportive crowd(because he's gay).		I enjoyed it though, it was a good performance.  That's what it was: a performance with a comedic plot.		I'm a huge stand up comedy fan, I watch them pretty	much every night before I fall asleep.  This doesn't really fit exactly within the genre of stand up comedy.		Edit: so I was incorrect that he's gay, my bad.  Doesn't change the fact that he's not funny and the majority of his audience wasn't laughing.Yes, people are only supportive of Bo Burnham because he's gay. Yep. You're not making any incorrect assumptions, no siree.  He's wildly popular only because he has a "supportive audience." Yep. Good job.

Is it worth watching the original after watching What.?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh676AbLjbw		Give it a go. Its a bit different because it wasn't designed for video like his later shows.
Is it worth watching the original after watching What.?100% I watched what first fell in love with his content and then looked for more. Words has a crazy cool concept I've never seen in stand up and really was awesome after watching what. 		I managed to see make happy live which was amazing and having that on Netflix was awesome. What will always be my favorite but jt was my first taste of his comedy which is incredible. 
My favorite show so far is definitely "Make Happy" That performance made me weep like a new born baby.		Seriously, I was not prepared for the existential crisis that it gave me.  After I was done watching it, I took an hour long walk and just....walked in silence.
I am your friend, buddy. I am also your buddy, pal.
Ohhh *that's* why Todd reminds me so much of JesseHooray! A connection.
Worth watching?The Path and 11/22/63 are both excellent and worth buying a month of Hulu for
