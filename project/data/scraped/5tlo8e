He gets really depressed in the middle seasons though But ultimately, coming out the other side of his depression he's not just back to 100% positivity, but back to 100% positivity *and* living a more balanced, less stressful life than he was before his depression.

What's show is this from?Parks and Recreation
This is fact. Mutts have never not been half amazing, half terrific. Its like they get all the best qualities from whatever breed made them up.Mutts are great, but sometimes they get all the worst qualities. Sometimes they just get a random grab bag of the two parents qualities, good and bad.		That's why people like pure breeds. It's a consistent set of qualities dog after dog. If I love having a beagle or labrador retriever, when it comes time to get a new dog I can get one of those and get one that's pretty close to my old dog in terms of health problems, general energy and disposition, etc.
I'm lost. Isn't that Rob Lowe? Chris Traeger is the character Rob Lowe plays on the tv show Parks and Recreation
Chris Traeger is cool but his positivity is a bit un-human and weird. I like wholesome meme's vibe betterHe's the type of person that is great as an individual but if everyone acted so chipper all the time it'd be really odd. 
Tbh that's a motto more of us should adopt. She was crying, so I helped. You see a problem, you try to help. That's all. A lot of people hate being talked to/disturbed when they are crying. I do personally, because I'm embarrassed that someone noticed I was upset. So I don't console people, because I'm worried that I'd upset them by trying to intervene.
Tbh that's a motto more of us should adopt. She was crying, so I helped. You see a problem, you try to help.

It can be hard to help others when you need to dedicate most of your time just to the upkeep of your own life.

It's a hard one but it's so worth it. I'm reading Alan Carr's book right now and he really helps frame the addiction in a way that makes it easier to stop. 
they're too mean to him it makes me sadBut he has an amazing family, loves what he does, and ends up getting to be mayor in the end.		He'd get the last laugh, except he's too busy being happy to worry about getting the last laugh.
they're too mean to him it makes me sadThe cast of the show felt so bad for treating him that way. That's the reason he has such an otherwise perfect life, apart from being the uberklutz.
they're too mean to him it makes me sadI think the point about jerry is that he's made fun of all the time yet he's married to a super model, has great kids and a happy family, lives comfortably, has a huge penis, becomes a successful mayor, and lives till a hundred and something. Objectively almost anyone would kill to have his life. 
That's because outside of work, he's going home to his beautiful wife and daughters, and has tons of great friends and many talents! He's fine with the unwholesome work environment because everyone in his personal life is so great.And he has the biggest penis like, ever. 
more than once, no?	She thought they were dating... twice.
I want to meet this guyHe wants to meet you too and befriend you and tell you all types of things he loves about ducks and donkeys that has nothing to do with anything untoward and then ask if you'd like to go on a jog tomorrow morning.		It's really kind of oddly refreshing how friendly he is. 
But ultimately, coming out the other side of his depression he's not just back to 100% positivity, but back to 100% positivity *and* living a more balanced, less stressful life than he was before his depression.All thanks to Dr. Richard Nigard.

April Ludgate is mine.	That is great! It brings a good balance to the world!
Yep. It's from Parks and Rec. [deleted]
Yeah....the idea of putting Rob Lowe's face on wholesome makes me lol.Rob Lowe's personal history makes that character even better, imo.
Mutts are great, but sometimes they get all the worst qualities. Sometimes they just get a random grab bag of the two parents qualities, good and bad.		That's why people like pure breeds. It's a consistent set of qualities dog after dog. If I love having a beagle or labrador retriever, when it comes time to get a new dog I can get one of those and get one that's pretty close to my old dog in terms of health problems, general energy and disposition, etc.No way in my experience,  all my pure breds have ended up with typical disorders. Hip problems for Alsatians,  head problems for cavalier king charles,  even my jack Russell terrier had a digestive problem that made her this ball of muscle because she couldn't po rocess fat properly (or something like that,  i was 13) and had to be on medication. 		Then i got a bitsa and she has lived 3 times as long and in perfect health!  She's currently 14 :-) 		But I'm very glad your experience was different and you had happy doggos! 
A lot of people hate being talked to/disturbed when they are crying. I do personally, because I'm embarrassed that someone noticed I was upset. So I don't console people, because I'm worried that I'd upset them by trying to intervene.Same. For this reason I almost never get very upset in public, it just feels embarrassing. 
I think many people probably would, but at least in America, it just seems everyone is hurting for time, all the time. If we had more free time and werent always in a rush or on such strict schedules I think most people would have this mind set.		It can be hard to help others when you need to dedicate most of your time just to the upkeep of your own life.Its not just time we also live in an age where being wrong can lead to mass public humiliation. A lot of people just don't want to risk getting involved in other peoples problems for fear of being wrong about their assumption.
