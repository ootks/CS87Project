Gordon Ramsay can be wholesome too!Gordon's actually a really great guy. He gets such a bad rap because we watch him deal with supposed "experienced" people. He points out their mistakes, though he does it in a manner that seems awful (if only for the cameras), but he only does this to get people to man up to their mistakes and make it better. Hell's Kitchen is a great example, he points out when people do something wrong, but he also lets them know when they've done something "perfectly", and rewards them. Even the one's who have won Hell's Kitchen get yelled at consistently throughout the season.	Also- I've watched some of his videos when he's with his family and he's this huge teddy bear. Typical father with the dad jokes, and is so infuriatingly adorable!

It always makes me happy when Gordon Ramsay tweets are posted on here, he seems like a genuinely good guy.

Except for the kids master chef or whatever, he seems great with kids.
It always makes me happy when Gordon Ramsay tweets are posted on here, he seems like a genuinely good guy. Something like your favorite celebrity replying to you on Twitter can make someone's day :)He's such an ass sometimes. Then he has moments like on the season of Masterchef where Christine was a contestant. She was unsure about a dish she presented. He described it to her in loving detail because she was blind and couldn't see how beautiful it was. The kindness and tenderness he showed her in that moment felt really genuine to me.

Something like your favorite celebrity replying to you on Twitter can make someone's day :)It really says a lot about US culture how much the show changed between the UK and the US versions of Kitchen Nightmares.  US is so focused on the family drama aspect and yelling matches and the UK is really focused on making people better and generally caring about getting a business to succeed.  I think they know exactly what type of audience they are generally pandering to.
It always makes me happy when Gordon Ramsay tweets are posted on here, he seems like a genuinely good guy. Something like your favorite celebrity replying to you on Twitter can make someone's day :)I think he's the way he is for the ratings. He knows when he's being an ass- which is entertaining/cringe/omg he's such a jerk! Then he has those moments where he praises ppl and it's like a "wow, he really does recognize talent" and when *he* praises someone *we* will automatically think the dish is 100x better because praises aren't given by him, unless they deserve it		With the kids he was nice, and wasn't hard on them. Definitely wholesome. Adults *should* be able to handle his critiques, if he was mean to the kids with out offering any help then viewers would be pissed off		It's all for ratings though, and he is entertaining. When we as viewers catch a chef messing up, we can't help but wait for the yelling. He doesn't even try to be sentimental, but *lashes* out		I love one bit in the kids version when a chef is crying and he tells them that his kids always cry in the kitchen, but it's from laughing and having a fun time- never from beating themselves up over something. I got chills when he said that!		EDIT: I would like point out how some shows focus on being nice, and let people down in a nice way. Ex) *The Voice* will tell people in a nice way how they have potential but aren't "ready" yet. Wholesome TV is a thing, but we kinda crave the insults because most of us wouldn't give insults like that in real life- even when we're thinking it (think Simon Cowell in *American Idol*)

I'm from the US, but I watched the Great Irish Bake Off from here (a spin off of the highly popular Great British Bake Off) as one of my cousins was a competitor. I remember being almost shocked at how nice everyone was! In one episode, my cousin had to make a special kind of cake she didn't know how to make. Even though it was relatively late in the season, one of her competitors helped her out. My cousin wasn't eliminated that day and ended up winning the season, thanks to some friendly advice. That sort of atmosphere doesn't even exist in the American cooking shows!
Cheer up friend! You'll find the one:)They're $3.99 a lbs at the grocery store. It's not that hard.

I love watching him fix restaurants up in London, but there's a subdued sense of his mannerisms that he saves for the Americans.

Totally agree. The U.K. stuff is interesting, helpful and he's kind, caring and just wants people to be their best.		Our US version just fucked everything up and made it reality tv.

Speaking as an American, I've found anytime there's a British version of a TV show, and an American version, the British version is better.It's fascinating to see how distinct the cultural trends are in reality TV from different parts of the world.

Speaking as an American, I've found anytime there's a British version of a TV show, and an American version, the British version is better.Unfortunately that's what sells in US. People don't care about how to cook a unique dish, they care about which chef hates which chef. See Masterchef Australia and compare it with Masterchef US, it's like earth and heaven on level of difficulty of food and personal drama.

He's great with everyone. He just act super mad because apparently that's what sells in US tv market. He's actually a very caring person for everyone, his image as angry man is just for ratings.And he's passionate about what he does.

I think his assiness is just him playing a character, from what I've heard he's a great guy IRL. Wholesome Gordon :)I think he exaggerates things for his TV character, but it definitely comes from a real place.  I've seen a raw video (not meant for TV) where he was very agitated and swearing in the kitchen, but it was admittedly under extreme, uncommon circumstances where anyone would be hard-pressed to keep their cool.  Other than that, everything I've seen of him outside his character is very genuine and kind.  Gordon is a good dude.

The American editions also go absolutely overboard with intense music and cuts everywhere. The UK version has Ramsay go on long periods of just talking to the people without any cuts or music.

I remember when I first watched Hell's Kitchen I couldn't understand why people liked the guy so much.

I wish more American TV was like his UK show.
I remember when I first watched Hell's Kitchen I couldn't understand why people liked the guy so much. 		When I saw his British work it really put the respect and loyalty people had for him into perspectiveHis show 'The F Word' is wonderful. He's always so lovely to his guests, with a healthy amount of banter. 
He yells at the people on hells kitchen because they think they're the shit, and they're not. When he works with kids for instance, he doesn't think the same way because, y'know, they're kids.IIRC, a lot of the winners on that show either got denied visas to work for one of his restaurants or become essentially a line cook because they don't have what it takes to be executive chef. My SO who follows the show and used to work in foodservice said that one of the winners in the seasons was legit and everyone else sucks. 		I've also read that the contestants are sleep deprived and given lots of alcohol, but don't quote me on that. 		Edit: http://foodiegossip.blogspot.com/2014/07/hells-kitchen-winners-where-are-they-now.html		One of them reportedly denied the job in London and it looks like quite a few of them have established successful careers. There seems to be a trend in that they get the title of executive or head chef but in reality aren't given the roles for it. 
He yells at the people on hells kitchen because they think they're the shit, and they're not. When he works with kids for instance, he doesn't think the same way because, y'know, they're kids.Also he doesn't yell at all adults, only those he can't seem to get through to in any normal way.  You watch him gently tell people what they're doing wrong, and it's when they arrogantly continue messing things up because they think they know best, that's when they get yelled at.  The TV shows specifically choose match-ups with that kind of person in order to get the best drama (and this is more true of the American shows for various reasons).
There came a point where certain aspects of his personality (his abraisiveness when he feels slighted, his zero tolerance for below par work, his foul mouth) became what he was known for and what the networks wanted him to play up for ratings. 		His earlier work on British TV had heart and showed his genuine passion for food and cooking. Sadly now he is expected to blow up in exaggerated fashion at least once an episode to cater for US television networks but he has always come across as a genuinely nice dude.Comparatively, his language was extremely tame for the US shows, the UK shows had his real personality. Along with cursing like a sailor.
Did you watch British baking show? The contestants were actually nice to each other rather than not giving a fuck about anything besides winning.That show was the best! I would give my firstborn for 10 more seasons of it. Not planning on having kids, so I guess that wouldn't really be a sacrifice, but still.
I agree with you with this exception... The american versions of Shameless and The Office are way better  than their british counterparts. Yeah, but as cringey as the Office is, it's a very wholesome-when-it-matters show.
I agree with you with this exception... The american versions of Shameless and The Office are way better  than their british counterparts. And House of Cards. There's no comparison for that one.
I agree with you with this exception... The american versions of Shameless and The Office are way better  than their british counterparts. I've never seen either, but from what I've heard living in Britain everyone here hates the American version of the office.

It's because he knows how to manage a kitchen and to do that, you can't be friends with everybody. It's as simple as that He's perfectly nice until he tells you to do something and you mouth off or do a shitty job. Then he destroys you.

You roast pig, Ramsay roasts you. Full circle achieved. But who roasts Gordon Ramsay?
I find this about American TV in general. I don't know why they're so obsessed with dramatic music and dramatic cuts before every ad break. I'm watching a cooking show, not a soap opera.Trust me, most of us hate it too.
I recommend reading through his AMA that he's done on here. He seems like a very genuine, very hardworking man.I have. 		I truly believe that if we took a quarter of his hard work and passion placed it into the rest of the population we'd solve most of society's problems. 
I recommend reading through his AMA that he's done on here. He seems like a very genuine, very hardworking man.And he's aware of the Lamb Sauce meme so that's pretty great. It's nice to know he's in on the joke.

I recall he was very emotional about this as his pride was definitely on the line.		[source](https://ny.eater.com/2014/10/8/6948553/restaurant-gordon-ramsay-at-the-london-is-closing)

My thoughts exactly. Hell's Kitchen is such trashy reality TV bullshit. I wish more American TV was like his UK show.If you want a wholesome food show watch The Great British Bakeoff IMMEDIATELY. It is the most wholesome.
IIRC, a lot of the winners on that show either got denied visas to work for one of his restaurants or become essentially a line cook because they don't have what it takes to be executive chef. My SO who follows the show and used to work in foodservice said that one of the winners in the seasons was legit and everyone else sucks. 		I've also read that the contestants are sleep deprived and given lots of alcohol, but don't quote me on that. 		Edit: http://foodiegossip.blogspot.com/2014/07/hells-kitchen-winners-where-are-they-now.html		One of them reportedly denied the job in London and it looks like quite a few of them have established successful careers. There seems to be a trend in that they get the title of executive or head chef but in reality aren't given the roles for it. > I've also read that the contestants are sleep deprived and given lots of alcohol		In other words, they work in a kitchen

But the quote is fresh! Smell it! It's fantastic! Cook with it and you have a perfect addition to your reshterant menu! 
That show was the best! I would give my firstborn for 10 more seasons of it. Not planning on having kids, so I guess that wouldn't really be a sacrifice, but still.That's why it's not coming back man, the devil sees through your hustle!
I've never seen either, but from what I've heard living in Britain everyone here hates the American version of the office.It's probably because the american version is more wholesome than the british one. Thus, in their perspective, less realistic. 
Counterpoint: The OfficeBold comment dude 
>The steaks are high		I see what you did there.	It was pretty well done.
I've always seen him like Simon Cowell. Everyone deep down really only cares what he has to say because he is respected and will give you a no fluff response. He gives the truth and when people make poor dishes on his show he tells them that. If there is a good dish he tells them genuinely that. He holds people to a high standard.Except Cowell is a giant ass irl
But who roasts Gordon Ramsay?The pig.
I have. 		I truly believe that if we took a quarter of his hard work and passion placed it into the rest of the population we'd solve most of society's problems. Watch his videos of him going to Asia to learn about cooking styles. Truly humble man.

Watch his videos of him going to Asia to learn about cooking styles. Truly humble man.Gordon's Great Escape (2010, 2011) for those who are wondering. Probably my favorite series of Gordon Ramsay doing something purely because it is a masterclass in learning how to be humble and have an insatiable appetite for learning. Watching a man who is undoubtedly much more wealthier and "successful" (in a Western point of view) learn from common street vendors and villagers is something well worth the time. 		Edit: for those asking where to find the episodes, apparently most of them are up on YouTube. Other than that, I'm not really sure of any other *legal* ways of viewing the series unfortunately. 
Watch his videos of him going to Asia to learn about cooking styles. Truly humble man.i enjoyed seeing him get frustrated at how we asians don't really use measurements in our recipies. got a kick out of that :P
Watch his videos of him going to Asia to learn about cooking styles. Truly humble man.I actually didn't think much of him in Vietnam, his style of humour didn't translate well with his Vietnamese hosts. He went to extreme-dish places (snake is v niche in VN)  to get an idea of VN food and was disgusted. Perhaps he has little influence over locations though. He spat out a local dish in front of a gathered crowd of villagers, I winced. 		Having said all that, I love Ramsey's shows and watching him in his element, shaping chefs and delivering truth-bombs.
I'd argue that if we could honestly pursue our passions instead of working to just support ourselves we'd want to put in the hard work, but that's the idealistic commie in me talking. Soon robots will do most of the work, so that actually might happen. Not for us, but for the future generations.

I reviewed video games. When I had to review a game I didn't like and/or got into an argument with my boss because the review I gave didn't sit well with publishers/advertisers, I just hated everything and everyone.		You should pursue what your natural talents are in, not what your hobbies are. When you are good at something you create good work.
Gordon Ramsay Elon Musk team-up? Good food in space? Sure why not?

Other than that, I'm not really sure of any other *legal* ways of viewing the series unfortunately. Those videos really are something everyone needs to watch. This giant of a figure, both in stature compared to the places he goes, and also his financial and networking power, goes to the most modest of places. Why? To film some people in huts and practically turn them into animals or perhaps teach them some stupid crap from his world? Nope. He goes there to learn. And even though he's arguably one of the best chefs working, and without a doubt one of the biggest names in the culinary world, he wants to learn every facet from these people with genuine curiosity. And he does it without invading with his bullshit, trying to just take their knowledge and run or trying to take their knowledge and make it "wrong" or outdated or archaic. No, he just lets the people give him what they know, and gives back with work of his own.		Just great stuff, in every sense.
i enjoyed seeing him get frustrated at how we asians don't really use measurements in our recipies. got a kick out of that :PWhat do you do then? "Just throw a bit of pepper in." *student fills a tablespoon* "This much?" "I said a bit! That would kill someone!" "What? I don't know what a 'bit' is." *sigh* "you have much to learn."
Soon robots will do most of the work, so that actually might happen. Not for us, but for the future generations.Most people are worried about robots taking all the jobs. 		In my humble opinion, it'd be a great thing if robots took all the jobs no one wants to do. 		That way people would only have to do the jobs they wanted to do. 		People fret about robots replacing truck drivers and fast food employees. 		How many of those truck drivers and fast food employees would rather be artists, musicians, and writers? 		*Note: I'm aware that this is a simplification, but would be willing to discuss in depth when sober. 
Soon robots will do most of the work, so that actually might happen.

The idyllic version is that one day our machines will be so efficient and productive that we can afford to give out liveable wage to everyone enabling people to pursue hobbies and enjoy leisure but whether that is actually going to happen/what will happen is hard to say. 		First world problems will always exist and that age should it happen brings whole new divides and problems.

So it will likely be done that way.
I'd watch that show. I'd *pay* for that show.
