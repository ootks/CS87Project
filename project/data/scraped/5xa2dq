Michael deserves a dateMy friend did something similar on holiday in Spain. 		He bought around 8 or 9 limes from a corner shop, then went over to a group of girls sitting outside at a bar opposite and proceeded to clumsily drop them all over their tables and drunkenly exclaimed "oh no! How will I get any of you home without my PICK UP LIMES".		They were incredibly pissed off about the whole thing and told him to leave.

I found this funny, and hopefully for Mike the recipient likes him, but he doesn't "deserve" anything for a well-executed pickup actDepends your definition of "deserve".  It doesn't necessarily mean "owed".
I found this funny, and hopefully for Mike the recipient likes him, but he doesn't "deserve" anything for a well-executed pickup actIts a display of confidence and humor and a compliment to her.  Common traits that are sought after in a partner.  Not that anyone would owe him but it seems like youre acting like pick-up lines are some fucked up thing.
Actually, no one "deserves" a date. But everyone here deserves a hug.
Actually, no one "deserves" a date. Deserve- to be worthy of, qualified for, **or** have a claim to		Why argue a narrow interpretation that probably wasn't intended. People can certainly be worthy of or qualified for a date.		
Actually, no one "deserves" a date. I agree! But I fear that the societal conscience disagrees.
This is very sweet, but the title bothers me. =( 	No one is ever entitled to a date. Rather than look at it as a declaration of entitlement, I was choosing to read ~~it~~ the title in the spirit of 'everyone deserves a chance at happiness.'

Is [this](http://m.imgur.com/PB9d7?r) your friend? my favorite part of this is his face, he has such good humor about the fact that he's holding loose limes for no reason and obviously they're falling all over the place. he's having a good laugh about it.		it's like the opposite is those black and white over-dramatized infomercial things, where mundane things are amplified and the person is overly stressed about it.
Yeah the wife was talking about making some sort of Mexican meal, but imma steal her lime >:DBest part is you can still use the lime in cooking after you crack this joke! She'll laugh, you'll laugh, and then you both can have a wonderful evening cooking and eating! Win-win-win

Its a display of confidence and humor and a compliment to her.  Common traits that are sought after in a partner.  Not that anyone would owe him but it seems like youre acting like pick-up lines are some fucked up thing.No, they're just calling out a problematic assumption some people make that a good pickup line means that the recipient should feel they owe the person a "yes". There's nothing wrong with pickup lines, and I don't think the commenter was saying so, but it would be totally ok for the person being asked to say "Dude that's awesome but I'm not really interested, thanks for making me laugh though."
