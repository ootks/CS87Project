Footballer keeps his promise to a little girl with deaf parents.There an English rugby player called Owen Farrell who was years ago [asked to do a sign by a terminal ill boy](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/465258/England-fly-half-Owen-Farrell-shows-support-for-terminally-ill-boy-with-try-celebration). He still makes the same sign every time he scores. 
Footballer keeps his promise to a little girl with deaf parents.That made me a little teary!
Footballer keeps his promise to a little girl with deaf parents.Isco Disco! 
Footballer keeps his promise to a little girl with deaf parents.The guy is Isco Alarcn, midfielder of Real Madrid, one of the most important soccer clubs in the world.		In that game, which Real Madrid won 3-2 over Gijn, Isco scored 2 of the 3 goals of his team and assisted in the other one. Actually, he scored the third goal of the team in the last minute of the game, which was tied 2-2 until then.		And, although Real Madrid is first in the Spanish league, Barcelona is only 3 points behind (one game difference), so not only did Isco win the game for Real Madrid, he also probably won the league for them, as tying the game would have been disastrous and Barcelona would have gotten to just 1 point (they have to face each other this next Sunday.)		Apart from that, this has been a pretty rough season for Isco, as he's been out of the starting XI for most of the games. However, after this game, he started in the XI against Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinal this last Tuesday and will probably be again in the starting XI in the decisive games of the season.		So, that great gesture came in the best possible moment :)

Isco is a great guy. A lot of football players are actually cool guys in real life despite what they seem on the pitch. Absolutely true.  Zlatan is one of my favorite examples of this.  There's a video out there of him standing in line to walk out onto the Pitch with a kid and some older guy tries to switch his kid with the one standing next to him.  Zlatan just eyes him and calmly switches the kid back then walks out with him.  Total class act.

ASL IS METAL AF
Me too thanks!
Actually, for ASL the thumb is out also, not over the fingers. So not the same :D		The pinkie finger out alone means "i"		The index and thumb out means "L"		The pinkie and thumb stuck out mean "y"		So having all three fingers out is shorthand "ily" for "I love you" -- it's super neat.
You need the thumb out for "I Love You!" Otherwise it's just metal.
That actually means bullshit in ASL. Thumb out for love. 
"If you score, could you do this?"		"OK, tomorrow."		Even the confidence here is wholesome. Guy's just like, "oh okay yeah I'll score tomorrow." Love it :)and he scored twice, not just once. the goal that he scored to dedicate the celebration to the girl and her family was the winner of the match to make the scoreline 3-2.

He is pretty much regarded as having the highest work ethic in football or at least in the top 3 or so. That doesn't mean work rate on the pitch before anyone thinks I'm talking about it. I mean his absolute dedication to be as good as he can possibly be. He works incredibly hard on his technique, his athleticism, even only ever eating very specifically designed meals and nothing else. He stays on the training pitch longer than anybody. He wants to be the very best and works incredibly hard to do so. Not that other great players don't also do this, and not that Ronaldo doesn't have natural talent, but he really elevated himself to be one of the best players of all time through his sheer work ethic 	 	Like schwarzenegger he just had a goal to be the best and worked bloody hard to do so. 	 	He should be a player that every aspiring kid looks up to. And every person generally. 	 	Messi is still better mind 
[Probably my favourite post from that sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/footbaww/duplicates/42mj3c/ian_wright_seeing_his_old_mentor_for_the_first/)		[Or this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv8Ud-ruKrk)		Omg the 2nd one, the little kid scoring the goal, those fans are SO FREAKIN SWEET. Made me laugh-cry bc I'm so emotional from all the wholesome stuff I've been seeing in this post lol.

Probably not speaking ASL if they aren't speaking English. 		Might be only minor differences though. This is true, but ASL IS STILL METAL
Probably not speaking ASL if they aren't speaking English. 		Might be only minor differences though. Not sure if it was ASL or not but I'm 99.99% sure that's how you say I love you in ASL. Therefore it could be ASL or other languages use the same sign for I love you as ASL. 
Probably not speaking ASL if they aren't speaking English. 		Might be only minor differences though. ASL is heavily based on French sign language. ASL doesn't use the same grammar that English does. I would not be surprised if many of their signs are based on the French SL as well.

He didn't do it the first time because he was so confident he would score a second time. Now that's some massive confidence!he was on another level that game. Messi esque performance.

He didn't do it the first time because he was so confident he would score a second time. Now that's some massive confidence!I can just imagine the gut feeling he got if he realized he forgot to sign the first goal, which motivated to try his absolute hardest to get another so that he could make it right. 
They were probably bummed after the first one when he didn't do it. Then pow! He probably thought "oh no, I forgot to do the sign.  I have to score again and do it!"  So blammo, double score!

If you keep your thumb in, it does. Keeping the thumb in means "bullshit," thumb out is "I love you." It's the combination of the I, L, and Y handshapes.

I had always heard what you posted, but also heard tucking the index finger in is "Y". I L Y. Yep that's exactly it! Encompasses all three letters. I went through a phase of learning ASL and I was super excited when I realized that's why it means I love you haha. I never got very far but I still know that sign! 
Funny that it's the same in Spanish Sign Language, if that's what the young woman was using? yes, they are spanish. 		https://streamable.com/u37er

they did not pull him back, it was the goal in the 90th minute, the winning goal. his goal made the scoreline 3-2, so all of the team mates were really excited and wanted to hug him. 		https://my.mixtape.moe/uprsde.mp4		he scored two amazing goals and I think he was inspired by the little girl and her parents Watching football with commentary in a language other than English is brilliant.

Also you can see the massive grin on Zidane's face just from the shot of the side/back of his head.

That reassuring shoulder tap. Oh my God. If Ibra did that to me, I dont think anything bad would ever happen to me again. "Zlatan is here. You are safe with Zlatan."
[And this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eQ2h13twNQ) Zlatan love to talk the talk to the press but in real life, he's just a genuinely nice guy. Him and Pogba are so good with meeting kids.		That video by itself is really wholesome as well.		[And another one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwL-sigNOJ4)NO YOU'RE CRYING.
Why did he do it? Also, poor kid who was pushed back by Zlatan like he did something wrong.yeah that kind of sucked for the other kid

Oh my god this video destroyed me in the best way possible.  Something about that kid just makes my heart bleed.  Pogba just seems like such a good dude, really genuine too.If you haven't seen it yet, look up Jermain Defoe and Bradley Lowery.

Wait there are people who don't like zlatan?There's probably a Swede out there who read Zlatan's biography and thought "Hang on a second, I grew up there and my bike was stolen around that time."  	Then again he read Zlatan's biography, so he probably still likes him.

Therefore it could be ASL or other languages use the same sign for I love you as ASL. When my mother was taught sign language, that's the sign she was taught. When I learned a little, I was taught to sign the individual words. I, just the letter i pressed against your body or also signing 'me' was acceptable; love, which was crossing your arms with the intersection approximately over your heart so there's like an X across your chest; you, point at the person.		I'm certain that just like Christmas and many, many other terms, there are a lot of different ways to say I love you in ASL and other sign languages.
Not sure if it was ASL or not but I'm 99.99% sure that's how you say I love you in ASL. Therefore it could be ASL or other languages use the same sign for I love you as ASL. Yep. It's actually a combinations of the signs for i, l, and y. It's literally "ily". Similarly, "just kidding" is done as "j" then "k".
ASL isn't a transliteration of English into sign - it's an entire language unto itself, with its own grammar and symbolic vocabulary. Signing words by spelling them out alphabetically is the exception, not the rule. ASL is spoken by people all over the world. Small correction: people use sign languages all over the world, but ASL means American Sign Language. Here in Brazil we have LIBRAS for Linguagem Brasileira de Sinais (Brazilian Sign Language), and other countries have theirs. There are similarities between the two, but they're not the same, just like Portuguese and Spanish are similar but not the same.

yeah that kind of sucked for the other kid I mean that's true. It's not like it's that kid's fault his dad (or whoever the old man is) is a dick and tried to switch his kid with the one who was supposed to walk out.

Is it just me or would it not be logical for two deaf Spanish people to use ASL?>The ILY is a sign from American Sign Language which, as a gesture, has moved into the mainstream. Seen primarily in the United States and other Americanized countries, the sign originated among deaf schoolchildren using American Sign Language to create a sign from a combination of the signs for the letters I, L and Y (I Love You)		According to the [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILY_sign). So I think it's become more of an international sign, they probably use their own language sign language otherwise. 		
thank you, I want to be as wholesome as possible.I have a regular customer who is blind, he jokingly acted upset for a second when I said "see you later" one time. He was totally cool about it, even more so when I said "I'm glad you can smell the funny side of things" unfortunately he's much wittier than I am so that was our only interaction that I considered winning.

Seems like a good dude My GF works with a deaf guy. She told me a story recently. Their company had some international visitors, he managed to stroll by several times with a long white cane and dark sunglasses. My GF who was hosting the visitors ignored him as best she could. Until she walked them into the lab he works in and he was looking in his microscope wearing his glasses. He looked up and around as though he could hear them talking, my GF signed to him "stop being a dick". Her visitors looked at her oddly and she said clearly so he could lip-read "He's deaf and not very funny". They all fell about laughing.
