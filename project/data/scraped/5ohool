NSFWholesomeGetting to bed early means you can fit in some more reading time.
NSFWholesomeThat's my plan for tonight! After a long, exhausting night at the ER with my kid last night (stitches on her chin), I'm very much looking forward to a long and restful sleep tonight.

Tried it last night. It felt great. I did as well. Then I woke up 2 hours later and never fell back asleep. 
Tried it last night. It felt great. I tried it last night, laid awake for 4 hours. It felt awful.
Tried it last night. It felt great. My outlook did a complete 180.		I went from being sour and aloof to I don't even know how to describe it. I wasn't cheerful or happy, but I wasn't mean or anything. I started to feel pretty normal.

I don't get off work until 11 so it's impossible for me. :("Reasonable" is relative. 
I did as well. Then I woke up 2 hours later and never fell back asleep. I hope you sleep better tonight. It's quite important for your mental and physical well-being, so please try your best. Sweet dreams.
I tried it last night, laid awake for 4 hours. It felt awful.Here, have some z's! Hope they help!		zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
I tried it last night, laid awake for 4 hours. It felt awful.Sending you some sleep waves. Hope tonight goes better for you!
I tried it last night, laid awake for 4 hours. It felt awful.Have you tried reading? I lay awake sometimes if I do nothing, but usually I get super sleepy if I try to read in bed.  If I don't fall asleep, at least I feel good about reading something.  I usually get sleepy pretty quickly, though.

Is sex not wholesome?sure, but he means having a tone similar to the tone here. 		a warm and friendly one :)
1am is a decent hour for me1AM is my goal during school days. 
Dude, it's 6am for me. Though this is a reasonable hour as I get up at 2pmI've had a bad habit lately of going to bed at ~3:00am and sleeping in till 2pm. I sleep 12+ hours sometimes and I feel very awful and fatigued when I finally do get up.
> gym at 5:15		That sounds awesome I bet you have the entire gym to yourself at an hour like thatIn more envious of the work at 9, I've only heard of goverment and bank jobs showing up that late. 
>Sleep at ~9, wake up at 4		That's not even the recommended amount of sleep.7 hours I think falls under the recommended amount. I've noticed it's the optimum for me for waking up fresh - any more and it's hard to get the day going.

You should call a doctor when that happens. Not because there might be something wrong with them, but because the doctor might be lonely on night shift and need someone to talk to.
Where wholesomememe-ers invade less wholesome subreddits and dispense wholesomeness?Indeed. We need someone on every NSFW post on reddit!
Where wholesomememe-ers invade less wholesome subreddits and dispense wholesomeness?Idk if the people of this sub can handle it. Like going onto watchpeopledie and try to make it seem better lol
Where wholesomememe-ers invade less wholesome subreddits and dispense wholesomeness?So, like a reverse of the_Donald? I can be down with that
Found it.		https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5oali2/nsfw_what_is_something_everyone_should_try_at/Make a tent with the blanket connected to the fan. Haha, that sounds fun. 		They also had sleepover at a friends house. Just because you're an adult, doesn't mean that its not fun anymore. 
I submit 90% of the internet (AKA all the porn) as proof it is not.That's not true, some of the porn is very nice and not bad.
In more envious of the work at 9, I've only heard of goverment and bank jobs showing up that late. As somebody who leaves for her classes at 8:00am or earlier and who works at 4:30 am, I feel this.
In more envious of the work at 9, I've only heard of goverment and bank jobs showing up that late. Where I live that's the norm. 9 to 5.		Americans starting at 8 was really unusual to me.		Or are you just saying that people are "encouraged" to show up earlier?
In more envious of the work at 9, I've only heard of goverment and bank jobs showing up that late. Web Dev II Reporting in, regular hours are 10-5 :D 		Unfortunately winter is always extremely slow, so I have hours reduced to 11-4 till it picks back up.
I mean you're still on reddit so it can still have only been *so* much more productivebrowsing wholesome memes is productive! it's like fixing the heating system that warms my heart. 
Though less reproductive. Not reproducing is the cheapest way to go about things. 
I'll be really tired by the end of today so hopefully I will. Thank you! This subreddit is so positive! I love it!
I'll be really tired by the end of today so hopefully I will. Thank you! I always smoke a bowl before I go to bed. If that's something you can do, I would really recommend it. 
This fucking subredditI love it so much. The vast majority of reddit is filled with depressing, anxiety riddled posts and self depreciating humor. While anxiety and depression are serious issues, it's really nice to find a place full of optimists.		I love you all 
It's 1AM here and I have to wake up at 4:30.. Go to bed now, little one. Sleep deeply and feel good when you wake!	
Indeed. We need someone on every NSFW post on reddit!Sounds like an excuse to visit porn subreddits.

As somebody who leaves for her classes at 8:00am or earlier and who works at 4:30 am, I feel this.I always said to myself in college, "Things will get better" because working and going to school at the same time is one of the hardest things in life. 		Now I have a great job from 8:30AM-5:00PM Mon-Fri. No more late night studying or stress when I'm trying to relax because my dumb brain used to say "You should be studying right now." 		You'll get there too.
Where I live that's the norm. 9 to 5.		Americans starting at 8 was really unusual to me.		Or are you just saying that people are "encouraged" to show up earlier?I think it depends on the job - for my job it's 8:30-9, and people kind of show up whenever there. My job would work until your work was done though, so people would show up early to finish early.  		I also know people who work in finance on the west coast will work like 4AM-1 or something because of the markets. 
Where I live that's the norm. 9 to 5.		Americans starting at 8 was really unusual to me.		Or are you just saying that people are "encouraged" to show up earlier?A lot of minimum wage jobs go 7-3, 8-4, and 9-5, depending on which shift you take. It was pretty normal for me to wake up at 5:30 when I had a job at Chick fil-a.
So you don't get sleepy during the day?[deleted]
Not reproducing is the cheapest way to go about things. Great for the environment too.
This subreddit is so positive! I love it!I actually have a smile on my face now.  This is great!
I always smoke a bowl before I go to bed. If that's something you can do, I would really recommend it. See, I used to do this, and it would do nothing but keep me awake because I wanted to enjoy the high a bit. Then about an hour later, the sedating effects are worn off and I'm still semi-high but awake. 		That's just me though, most people swear by this. 
I always smoke a bowl before I go to bed. If that's something you can do, I would really recommend it. I like edibles as well, before bed, because it takes around an hour to kick in and works as you are sleeping. You get a more sound sleep.
Sounds like an excuse to visit porn subreddits.Did you need one...?
"Jeez, it's too bad that man got beheaded. Here's hoping he had a quick, painless death!" "At least he had a good life insurance plan so his family doesnt have to struggle while they grieve!"

Once you're peaking, you won't wanna get up. 		Or read a book before bed whilst high helps too. 
Did you need one...?Well it would certainly help with explaining my browser history to my wife....
How'd you convince me to begin meditating? Completely serious.[deleted]
