ReunionIt's hard to believe it's been 12 years. Even harder to believe New Orleans is still dealing with the damage from it 
ReunionI love how their smiles still look exactly the same <3
ReunionWow she's grown but that smile is same. Have a wholesome life Y'all
Reunion12 year later, just made E-7. 		There's Air Force advancement for you. 
ReunionLooking at these two happy, smiling people makes me realize that time has ravaged my once youthful features. Why didn't I moisturize?!
ReunionThat dude probably feels really old now.
ReunionIt's so wholesome!
ReunionWow it's been 12 years already?
ReunionAir Force Pararescue men are ultimate bad asses
ReunionThis is almost violently wholesome.		How amazing to see two people share such a moment of unconditional completely unsexual love. Twice! The first time the love is coming from the guy, the second time from the woman. 
ReunionDo you think she joined JROTC because of him?
Reunion12 Fucking years? 
ReunionThe little girl in that picture is so cute it makes me angry.
ReunionI met the dude a number of times. He would visit us in BMT Medhold. That place is practically designed to murder your hopes and dreams, so him coming by was always a huge boost. The best days in there were when he would come in and just talk with us.		Very funny and good dude.
ReunionJROTC? That's highs school. Don't they mean ROTC. 
ReunionThis is awesome. Especially because his actions probably directly influenced her decision to join ROTC. Not "ooh rah 'Mericuhhh!" childish thoughts of killing bad guys, not some feeling of patriotic devotion, but a genuine desire to help others. He showed her what good the armed forces can do.
It's hard to believe it's been 12 years. Even harder to believe New Orleans is still dealing with the damage from it Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me.

12 year later, just made E-7. 		There's Air Force advancement for you. Service before Self!
12 year later, just made E-7. 		There's Air Force advancement for you. many career fields in the AF move higher enlisted into supervisory and administrative roles which takes them out of operational activities.  Many of these ops guys put off being promoted so they don't get pulled from actually doing the job they quite literally dedicated their life to.

The effects may not be fully reversible but the impact can be lessened. Using a broad spectrum sunscreen and a lightweight moisturizer regularly can make a world of difference and don't take much primping time :)

Air Force Pararescue men are ultimate bad assesMr. Maroney was cadre at the PJ school house for quite awhile. We call him the Abyss. One of the toughest, most genuine humans I've ever met.
Air Force Pararescue men are ultimate bad assesDad was a PJ, can attest
Do you think she joined JROTC because of him?Could be!
Do you think she joined JROTC because of him?I'd like to think so!
JROTC? That's highs school. Don't they mean ROTC. Maybe she's in JROTC? 
JROTC? That's highs school. Don't they mean ROTC. If she was 5 in the initial photo (although I don't spend much time with kids so I'm probably bad at estimating ages), she'd be 17 now and still in high school
JROTC? That's highs school. Don't they mean ROTC. A military ball is something every JROTC battalion has to at least attempt to have every year, servicemen are commonly invited to these events.

He hasn't aged a day.Yeah, he's aged 12 years instead.
*Iconic?!* I'm not being cynical. I've never seen this photo before in my life. 		Edit: I regret giving anybody the impression that I wasn't being wholesome by wondering where this photo came from.

There is nothing wrong with that. You just missed it or don't remember and that's ok!

Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. Bits and pieces of New Orleans east still have a lot of empty land where there used to be houses. Honestly at this point the biggest effect isn't property any more as it is the population loss and the legacy the storm had for the city. Lots of suicides, loss of business, death of family members etc 
Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. Whole communities were displaced from New Orleans. Thousands of the city's poorest residents were uprooted and relocated to nearby cities (Houston took many, I believe) and many haven't moved back. The rebound of some areas (mostly white and middle/upper middle class) and complete dilapidation of others (mostly black and lower class) has fanned racial and economic tensions. As is sadly too frequent, politicians are riding the tide for election purposes and doing very little to bring people together.
Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. Hey I'm not trying to take away the thunder from New Orleans, but they weren't the only area hit and by no means were they hit the worst.		My home town of Pass Christian MS had a 36 foot tidal surge and my home had 26ft of water in it. My home is a mile off of the beach.		Just in our little coastal town, roughly 85% of businesses were completely destroyed. Our middle school and elementary school were turned to complete rubble, as was most of the rest of the town.		I worked for a missions organization for roughly 2 years rebuilding homes, feeding homeless displaced by the storm, and doing events to bring the community together.		The last home I helped rebuild was 3 years ago. The old woman who lived there didn't have insurance and was forced to use all of her saved up retirement money on an old motor home just so she could stay in the area she loved.

Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. Depends how you define effected. There are hundred of thousands of poor, mostly black people that didn't return to the city. Those are entire neighborhoods and cultures and all the connections they represented, all their contributions to the place lost. There are areas that haven't been rebuilt because the people didn't come back and/or the ones still there aren't important enough to rebuild. Then there are the wealthier areas that gained new territory in the city and no longer had to deal with having the poor and rundown bordering their dream version of NO. If you Google it you will see this spread and the accompaning gentrification. You will read about a rebounding NO and the underdog story of its rebuilding efforts. People will champion how much progress has been made while ignoring those hundreds of thousands that can't return to what they once had. 
Are there any areas in particular that are still affected?		I'm from the UK and haven't really kept up with it. This surprises me. I went down there for Mardi Gras and it went from richer beach house to desolate areas. I remember seeing a huge building that didn't have a window that was intact. Houses are still abandoned, overgrown yards and run down houses. Im sure you know of a few places that are like this.

I mean, to be honest things are pretty normal. No one is really dealing with it anymore, a lot of people think it's ridiculous that people bring it up every time they hear New Orleans. Not true, Katrina still affects our state to this day. Lots of blight and infrastructure hasn't fully come back. Our state has had too many problems and not enough money or resources to deal with it.

Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?Really depends on the neighborhood. But generally, no. Most "new houses" are made in mind to withstand another hurricane, especially those in the 9th ward that were built by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's foundation. It sounds wacky, but a lot of community time and effort went into the new structures there. In other parts of the city, where "new structure" is just due to gentrification, who knows. But generally, New Orleans is very strict when it comes to demolishing our historic buildings for new ones unless the old ones were already destroyed. 		Here's an example: http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/17/12/2B6CA1EC00000578-3200488-image-a-5_1439810377015.jpg
Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?One, foundations are not and were never the problem.		And two, in a flood risk area, I'd take a wood frame house on wooden stilts over a ground level house made entirely of solid concrete. 		It wasnt the hurricane that did the majority of the damage. It was the flooding caused by the hurricane.  
Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?Dude a little bit of brick and concrete is not going to stop 200 mph winds and 10-30 feet of flooding. All bricks in regards to tornadoes and hurricanes are just heavier debris. Have you never watched what storms are capable of?		From another [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3kvge8/eli5why_are_houses_in_parts_of_the_us_seem_to_be/cv13by8/), [this is what an EF4 tornado did to a brick school](http://dataomaha.com/media/pilger/damage-map/images/school-after.jpg). 
Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?When I went down to help with cleanup most houses were perfectly intact structurally, just too moldy to live in and too expensive to get cleaned.		3 feet of water sitting in your house for weeks will do that.
Are the new houses like in Europe with proper foundations and bricks/concrete or still from wood shavings 1 cm thin that collapse when you resist your body on the wall?The foundation or building materials of a house matter infinitely less than the fact that most homes are built on unstable, soft ground and are below sea-level. 
Wow, thanks for posting this. How is your area doing now?

A lot of businesses left but it made room for more mom and pops and the community came together around them. Our schools got massive donations (including like a 6 billion one from some oil guy in Saudi arabia)  we were a national blue ribbon school district that year too, continuing the tradition. I think they just hit their 20th straight year or something.		So things are going swell, there's just still a lot to be done
Every person I know that survived Katrina in New Orleans never moved back. They all lost their homes and didn't have the ability to rebuild. I just want to learn more about this. Did the insurance companies not payout for the houses lost? I thought you were required to have flood and hurricane coverage in areas that are prone to those disasters.
Really? Not Alabama? When I was 8 a group of drunk 40 year olds insulted, flipped me off, and threatened to hit me because I was wearing a UT jacket. Still haven't quite gotten past it. UT? Is that a college? Still, the fact that they thought it was worth insulting you over is very fucked up.

yea i thought it was weird myself. whatever floats his boat i guessIt's not weird - he was battling PTSD, and his rescuing her, and that fond memory helped him keep his mental wellbeing together.

Because the federal government insures against disasters, and people also had insurance on their homes and belongings, some people ended up double dipping and getting more than they needed, some people inevitably got fucked. 		And let me ask you this, would you rebuild in new Orleans? 
I just want to learn more about this. Did the insurance companies not payout for the houses lost? I thought you were required to have flood and hurricane coverage in areas that are prone to those disasters.The TL;DR of it is that many people couldn't afford to wait for the payouts from the feds, state, and insurance companies. 		It was cheaper to uproot and move out of the city and immediate metro (Westbank, Metairie, Kenner, LaPlace). That's why places like Covington and Slidell saw a population boom following Katrina. 
UT? Is that a college? Still, the fact that they thought it was worth insulting you over is very fucked up. University of Texas, yeah. Alabama people fans are *rabid* when it comes to football. 
What's the good news from Alabama?		No really, does anything good happen there?Well we have a moonpie that we drop on New Year's Eve 		If that's good news for you. I know it is for me. 
Speak for yourself!I am all crying on this blessed day

The answer to this is extremely complex. Because the federal government insures against disasters, and people also had insurance on their homes and belongings, some people ended up double dipping and getting more than they needed, some people inevitably got fucked. 		And let me ask you this, would you rebuild in new Orleans? I'm from Covington, about 40 miles north of New Orleans in the Metro. It took 18+ months for FEMA to give us a trailer and took a year to get the grants from the Road Home fund. That doesn't even include insurance payouts which took an eternity to get according to my parents. I don't remember the exact details because I was a kid at the time. 		Simply put many people didn't want to wait or couldn't afford to wait the months or years to rebuild, so they just uprooted and moved out of the city. The government wasn't prepared to handle the sheer loss that the entire region dealt with. 
University of Texas, yeah. Alabama people fans are *rabid* when it comes to football. Well I apologize on behalf of the other Crimson Tide alumni and fans.  Generally, we tend to be very polite to opponent fans and talk a little smack; But, of course, there are the arrogant fans that are assholes.  I apologize you had these shitty fans harass you.  
Roll Tide!!Not now, Mike.
