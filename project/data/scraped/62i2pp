We're a family!This sub is, quite literally, the best thing on the internet. I love that, since it blew up, all of Reddit has seemed to - sort of - changed. Not drastically, but little comments here and there, as if people are more conscious of what they say and I think that's wonderful.

We're a family!I love this community so much. I'm struggling with depression and wholesome memes is always a good pick-me-up.
We're a family!My girlfriend left me..
We're a family!I've found myself saying, "but that's alright" after something negative happens. It's interesting how a few words makes a situation better.
We're a family!Can someone link me a picture of the cows and dog without the text. My girlfriend loves cow pictures and I want to send her that. Thank you.
We're a family!Is that a fat joke?

http://imgur.com/gallery/NvujUEffin' Fred Rogers man...		As a kid, I would really care less about Mr Rogers and brush the show off completely.		As an adult, I need to hear this ~~sometimes~~ most of the time... 		Wonder why this is? Perhaps it is because we as kids have the parents that always tell us it is going to be ok and that we are special. But as adults, we have ungrateful kids and challenging marriages where it is negative most of the time. It is then kind of nice to have someone look you in the eyes and say that it is all ok, that what you are doing is just fine.

I quit my engineering track because I was failing physics and mostly failing calculus. I thought I could do it on my own because I thought my high school smarts would carry over to college. It didn't but I was too stubborn or embarrassed to get help. Or maybe I was just too lazy to put in that extra effort to succeed in something difficult. 	Years later, my girlfriend is in college and needed help with calculus. A calculus teacher friend of mine volunteered to tutor her and with his help, she went from a C to an A. 	So don't do any of what I did. :) Ask for help if you're trying to do it on your own. Ask the successful people how they're doing it. Resist saying "yeah, but I have to deal with..." Demand help where you need it and don't take any crap if anyone gives you a hard time about it.

I'm lonely as fuck. It's normal to be lonely. I get lonely too. If you ever want to play madden hit me up 
I'm lonely as fuck. You are here with us!

I love this community so much. I'm struggling with depression and wholesome memes is always a good pick-me-up.They pick you up because you are a good person. If you were made happier from hurtful memes, there would be more of a problem. You are good inside, even if the shadows seem to get dark, the light isn't far off. "If you are going through hell, keep going." (That quote helped me through some dark times.)
I love this community so much. I'm struggling with depression and wholesome memes is always a good pick-me-up.I've suffered with depression most of my adult life my friend. Every day is a blessing from whatever put us here, whether you believe in god or you're a man of science, you were put here on earth to do great things. 		Whether those great things are as huge as cure cancer or as small as being a good neighbor, friend or partner. Being kind to one another is the first step to a happy life. 		The world is full of darkness that can be lit up by one friendly encounter at a time - and although you may feel lost in this big wide world, just know that you are loved and I am so happy that you are here.

I like knowing there's a dog who thinks he's cows near me. 
What does cheer up mean?It is making someone feel better. For example if you are sad because someone hurt you, your friend would "cheer you up" by doing something you like or getting your mind off of it.

"You should sit in nature for 30 minutes every day. Unless you are busy, then you should sit in nature for two hours." It's a vicious cycle. If I am stressed I take some time to relax so I can focus. But then i realise that I haven't done anything in that time so I get even more stressed.
