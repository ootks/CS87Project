Can't deny that sparkThe look on her face in the bottom right picture is killing me. You can almost hear the donkey bray and her snorting with delight
Can't deny that sparkI definitely should have posted my original photos here instead of /r/funny... People are nicer here 
Can't deny that sparkWhat a nice ass.
Can't deny that sparkI love her smile, it's so infectious. It makes me really happy. That's such raw genuine happiness.
Can't deny that sparkJenna Marbles, is that you?

Can't deny that sparkI was invited to acquaintances going away party (whom I probably only hung out with a few times in the last year) on Sunday to a brewery. I was hungover from the day before and contemplated not going. Eventually I just said fuck it and thought that if he put the thought in inviting me that I should make the effort. In the end I am happy I did because a cute girl came up to me out of the blue and introduced herself. We exchanged numbers, got sushi afterwards and now have plans for drinks tomorrow.		So in the end I got to see off a friend and meet someone that I am excited to see more of while enjoying some great weather and beer.		Life has a weird way of rewarding the littlest effort.
Can't deny that sparkWhenever I meet someone and we hit it off they usually turn out to be a jackass.

Can't deny that sparkThey have the same smile
Can't deny that sparkA study found that animals often make assessments about human attractiveness and are influenced by it, preferring contact with humans they find physically attractive, although behavior and scent figured in somehow as well. Their tastes, coincidentally or not, happen to not be very different from our own. It seems standards of physical beauty may be universal. 		I do remember them saying red or blonde hair and fair skin rate very highly, so maybe there's good cause for that little guy to look so smitten.
Can't deny that sparkShe is obviously fully aware of the comparison and took the last picture and posted them intentionally. She's ok with poking fun of herself a bit, because she's most likely got a healthy sense of self esteem and confidence. I mean, she just looks like a really fun person from the picture.		I watched on youtube Felicia Day visiting a goat cheese/milk farm for a day and it looked like a lot of fun. Since then, I've always wanted to do something like that (always been a city boy), but I've kinda forgotten about it. This reminds me of that again :). 
The look on her face in the bottom right picture is killing me. You can almost hear the donkey bray and her snorting with delightI hope you're not really dying, friendo! We care about you!

The look on her face in the bottom right picture is killing me. You can almost hear the donkey bray and her snorting with delightThey have pretty much the same smile too.

They talk like discount Canadians		Source: Small town Canadian childI'm almost ashamed to say it, but I was conflicted as to whether the voice I was reading was Canadian or Minnesotan. I guess Fargo won that one. Also, I know a lot of Norwegians, and they are generally supremely wholesome, so I settled on Minnesotan.
For me, it's because I'm currently watching Fargo Oh yaah that's a good show.
