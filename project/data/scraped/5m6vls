It's all in our hands!We but mirror the world. All the tendencies present in the outer world are to be found in the world of our body. If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. This is the divine mystery supreme. A wonderful thing it is and the source of our happiness. We need not wait to see what others do.  Mahatma Gandhi

The thing is I don't. If I may voice a counterpoint to the post, I sit here and see this as I PERSONALLY have the power to make 2017 the best year on record. I had this with 2016 as well and I'm now more depressed than ever despite the innovation of this lovely sub after an early high. I love positivity as much as the next guy, but there's a limit. Perhaps I'm a bit misguided.Incremental progress is the only way. Use your 2017 fire to fix one small tiny thing. Then when 2018 gets here you know that not only did things not get worse, you proved to yourself they can get slightly less terrible. 		Also I feel ya. I hope you feel better. 
No worries friendo. Please be mindful in the future though. I know it can be difficult so just try and do your best to find the original source of such works when possible so that the artist can get credit.

Not wholesome at all. WHERES THE BAN? I had recieved it from a friend of mine and was unaware. But hey, if a ban needs to happen to set a precedent I totally get that. The sub is more important than one person!
