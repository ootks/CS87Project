The only good April Fool's jokeApril Fool's Day has become a horrible day on the web.		OTOH, finding this sub has made every day since a heck of a bunch better, least for the brief moments when I look at new posts each day.		I'm betting you all can even take some of the horror out of April 1^st   this year.		Have an awesome day, everyone!

One looks like a teddy bear and the other looks like a pizza. 		I'll take them both!This subreddit is too wholesome to point out exactly what bear it looks like.

This sounds like my reasoning when thinking about how many dogs I should adopt.This really sounds like bioshock infinite's thought process behind a floating city. 		If an atom can float, why can't an apple?		If an apple, why not a city?
This sounds like my reasoning when thinking about how many dogs I should adopt.The right answer is, the number is only limited by your ability to take care of them. For instance, I can't handle more than one Husky.
Whoah whoah, no need to blow this outta PUPortion... Username checks out haha
What business are you two in?The dating business
This subreddit is too wholesome to point out exactly what bear it looks like.Huh?

The dating businessOh gotcha. Wasn't sure what you meant. Thanks for the downvotes everyone, god forbid someone not understand everyone's comments every time!
Huh? ...Pedobear, that really old, relentless 4chan meme. 
[Relevant concept art](http://imgur.com/7aONHIJ)Is this actually in the game? 
Oh gotcha. Wasn't sure what you meant. Thanks for the downvotes everyone, god forbid someone not understand everyone's comments every time!You probably didn't mean it this way, but 'what business are you in?' is a popular not-always-nice gay joke where I come from, so that might explain the downvotes? 		The point of the 'question' in that context is to force the original party to disclose their sexual preference out loud, even though the asker (and everyone else around) already knows that person is gay. In that context the 'joke' is usually meant to belittle the other person, or call out their differences in front of others. 		Hope this was helpful. We all make faux pas, ya know.

YesUsername checks out.
YesThat's hilarious.
It wasn't a faux pas. I didn't know. That's ok. You say everyone knew but they didn't, because I didn't, and I matter		Thanks anywayNo dude I'm literally saying that you didn't know and it's not your fault. The explanation was to frame why others were mistakenly downvoting you. Just trying to help dude.
