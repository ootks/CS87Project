Thank you for pointing that out, I made a small leap of judgement sorryAnd the important thing is that you apologized.
Hey everyone, I'm new! My name is Katy but you can also call me the penguin of wholesomeness! As you can see I'm very nice! That's why I came here, to meet more nice people like me. I'm 13 years old (I would consider myself very nice for my age, but I know that people are different so it's ok if other people are less nice) and I like to be nice to strangers with my girlfriend (I'm bisexual, if you don't like it that's ok because it's your opinion) because it's our favourite free time activity, because it's just so nice! She's nice too, but I want to meet more nice people, because like they say: The more nice people the more happy people. Anyways, I hope to meet lots of friends here so just contact me :)		I HOPE YOU ARE ABLE TO REACH ALL THE GOALS YOU HAVE <---- me being nice again :)		Much love		The penguin of wholesomeness*holds up comfort blanket*		EDIT: Should have said *slanket*. Sorry, everyone!
