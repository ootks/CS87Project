Military dude comes home to surprise his fatherI used to be in JROTC before I left for the military. One of my instructors was the best men I've ever known, that I credit him with putting me in the military more than my father. He got cancer while I was overseas and I was only able to visit him once before he passed away. It was quick and painless and I glad his family got to have that at least.		This house, as well as this man, resemble him so much it brought memories flooding back. I wish he was still alive to see how much influence he had on people, his family, and friends. All those students he was able to help. I learned so much from this man. 		RIP Chief.

i've come to accept that i will never love my father this much. he was always putting food on the table and providing for his family, but he was a salty, grumpy, bible beating authoritarian, and i will never have more than the most basic relationship with him. How old are you? I only ask because I felt the same way about my dad until I was older (mid twenties) and could have an adult relationship with him. As a teenager he was a real hard ass authoritarian (bible thumping too). It didn't bother me much other than be annoying and unnecessary. I was a "good" kid, didn't go out of my way to disobey him or anything, but the few times I broke the rules (always unintentionally and usually outside of my control) he came down on me as if it happened all the time.  		Now that I'm older, I think I understand him better. He wasn't a great dad, he definitely wasn't bad. He could have gone out of his way more to try to develop a relationship with us and take an interest. But he also tried to make us respectful and responsible, and even though his methods weren't great he was doing the best he could.  		 Now that I'm older (30) and he doesn't have to worry about raising me, things have mellowed out dramatically. We have some common interests and the religious stuff we just don't really bring up.  		This may not be the case with your father, I just wanted to bring another perspective that sometimes those things change, and sometimes people don't know any better. Your dad may be grumpy forever, but it may also just be partly due to the stresses of things going on (raising kids, work, etc). That doesn't make it ok, but it may mean that it won't last forever.

Oh man, it always bugs me when I see TVs over the fireplace. That's way too high up, you're gonna hurt your neck like that. And if it's a usable fireplace, that's just a disaster in the making.To each their own. Having my tv on a stand was uncomfortable and mounting it with a tilt down made it soooo much more comfortable watching. Most couches you lean back a little and your head naturally tilts up. It's perfect and makes watching much more comfortable. I don't watch tv with perfect posture in an office chair.
Go surprise them sometime soon anyway?My Mom has stroke related dementia. Mostly ok and happy but I moved back to Philly from the West Coast about two years ago.		She always forgets I moved back here so when I see her, she thinks I flew all the way again.		It's *always* a big surprise for her and she is always so happy.		Silver lining, I think.

The fact that his kids have moved out and his wife left him has only made him more salty and stubborn since he's lost control.

Aww, I teared up at that. Wish I had a way to surprise my parents like that.I go home rarely but speak regularly with my folks. I went home one time and let myself in early Sunday morning with my key and started making a big hearty English breakfast. They woke up due to the smells of bacon, eggs, blood sausage, etc. and we proceeded to have the best brekkie ever after all the tears had cleared. I love and miss my folks so much. Go hug your parents and say you miss and love them. And say thank you for what they've sacrificed in their lives for yours being better than theirs. 		And if you don't have a good relationship with yours, just say hi anyway if you're able to.

Is your house on fire Clark? 		Is Rusty still in the Navy? Don't get the reference but I guess you're making a dementia joke.			That's fine. Ma always had a dark sense of humor.
I think he's saying if that's the only reason don't do it, not to not join in generalUsually people join in Private; joining in General is nigh impossible to do.
It really depends on what you do while in. Some jobs are like day jobs, except you show up in a camouflage uniform (HR jobs for example), while others are just painful to do unless you want to be a grunt (infantry!).		If someone is joining the military, it should be because they want something out of it; whether it's to serve, go "on their own" for a while, learn usable skills, pay for school, etc, it shouldn't be because they want to surprise grandma at Christmas dinner. I'm trying to be wholesome here, but the same feeling could be achieved by simply visiting unannounced after a while.		You're signing your life away for however long your contract is (3, 4, 6 years usually) so you better really *want* to join. For some, that aforementioned reason of visiting family is enough, but for the vast majority of others it isn't. It's a pretty significant decision regardless.  [deleted]
