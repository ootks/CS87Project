Ex-Presidential boredomMade me think of [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/Lu0KLNE.png)
Ex-Presidential boredomThe poster in the background is a nice touch
Ex-Presidential boredomMy dad got like this when he retired.		Like fuck dad I love you but you need a damn hobby.
Ex-Presidential boredomThe Lilo and Stitch cross stitch is wonderfully wistful
Ex-Presidential boredomHis yellow socks really made me happy for some reason :)
Ex-Presidential boredomDon't you know? Obama watches GameGrumps in his free time. 		Good old Denny and Arnold!
Ex-Presidential boredomIn before the wholesome lock.
Ex-Presidential boredom> Do you wanna talk about boys?						> -- DAD!!						:) :D
Ex-Presidential boredom> ^she ^kicked ^me ^out ^of ^the ^garden		:'(
Ex-Presidential boredomYa know, even though I didn't agree with a lot of the things he did, he always strikes me as a dude that you can just walk up to and chill with. Obviously it isn't that easy but still, he just seems extremely approachable and friendly. 
Ex-Presidential boredomLocking this thread. The political discussion is attracting not so wholesome commentary and attacks.
Ex-Presidential boredomNot to be unwholesome, but wow Adam Ellis actually made a decent comic
Ex-Presidential boredomDoes it make anyone else happy thinking about how, after 8 years of presidency, Obama can now just... relax? And do whatever he likes with his time? I mean, even *I* feel a weight off my shoulders thinking about it...
Ex-Presidential boredomHe's like Jerry Smith from Rick and Morty

Ex-Presidential boredomI never thought of Obama as adorable until this comic.

Ex-Presidential boredomI never fail to chuckle at the Obama Means Family thing.
Ex-Presidential boredomyou know, i wouldnt be surprised if this is pretty accurate. I think Malia would respond better though, they raised her well and she's a nice young lady		E: I guess I was a little too wholesome
Ex-Presidential boredomIt makes it funnier if you read it in his voice.
Ex-Presidential boredom[removed]
Ex-Presidential boredomNobody is going to point out the "Let's go the movies" instead of "Let's go TO the movies"? It's probably because this is r/wholesomememes silly me :)
Ex-Presidential boredomObama is so adorable!
Ex-Presidential boredomWe need an animated Obama's cartoon now

Made me think of [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/Lu0KLNE.png)It's still weird to me to see Julia Kaye's comics floating around with her deadname on them. 
The poster in the background is a nice touchThat's from Lilo and Stich, right?
The poster in the background is a nice touchYup, jumped right out at me as particularly wholesome.		Part of me hopes that Barack is out there somewhere having a beer with Anthony Bourdain and just eating noodles with no pretense of politics.
His yellow socks really made me happy for some reason :)They were white a week ago...
Don't you know? Obama watches GameGrumps in his free time. 		Good old Denny and Arnold!I'm..gonna fucking pre, dude.
Don't you know? Obama watches GameGrumps in his free time. 		Good old Denny and Arnold!That Arnold. He, uhh... sucks at video games.
> ^she ^kicked ^me ^out ^of ^the ^garden		:'(His excitement was disquieting the roses.
> ^she ^kicked ^me ^out ^of ^the ^garden		:'(What is he, Adam and Eve? 
Not to be unwholesome, but wow Adam Ellis actually made a decent comicidk even when he's drawing actual people he still gives them the exact same face.

Not to be unwholesome, but wow Adam Ellis actually made a decent comicYeah seeing that artwork causes instinctive cringe, but this one was pretty good

[removed]Being subbed to both gets confusing sometimes
you know, i wouldnt be surprised if this is pretty accurate. I think Malia would respond better though, they raised her well and she's a nice young lady		E: I guess I was a little too wholesomeBased on what? 
[removed]You're in wholesomememes, the comic strips here are often more 'slice of life wholesome' than 'punchline funny'		But yeah, that spelling error is crazy, I guess I just automatically filled in the missing word. 
I love the poster! 		I hope there's another one based on the beautiful island that Barack is writing his book from. The island was once owned my Marlon Brando, who had great taste		http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-is-holed-up-writing-his-book-on-the-most-luxurious-south-pacific-island_us_58d97ecfe4b0f805b32290a8?ncid=engmodushpmg00000006		Edit: fixed the link so that we can see the beautiful place!Right next to that island owned by Jeffrey Epstein right?

Even Wholesome getting political? Great....I mean, it's political insofar as featuring our late President, but has zero actual political content within.

It's still weird to me to see Julia Kaye's comics floating around with her deadname on them. What does that mean?
That's from Lilo and Stich, right?Yes, but it is a part of the Hawaiian culture. "Ohana" is changed to Obama here.
That's from Lilo and Stich, right?no obama was the president of the united states silly
That's from Lilo and Stich, right?yup :)	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U0xGBNl2fE
Yup, jumped right out at me as particularly wholesome.		Part of me hopes that Barack is out there somewhere having a beer with Anthony Bourdain and just eating noodles with no pretense of politics.He's actually getting back into politics--he's gonna work with the Democratic Party to combat gerrymandering.
Yup, jumped right out at me as particularly wholesome.		Part of me hopes that Barack is out there somewhere having a beer with Anthony Bourdain and just eating noodles with no pretense of politics.If he is then I am super jealous, I would love to have a beer and a meal with Anthony Bourdain. But also if he is, he sure as hell earned it a lot more than I did. 
They were white a week ago......ew
I'm..gonna fucking pre, dude.Ohhhh I'm gonna complete 
That Arnold. He, uhh... sucks at video games.He didn't even know how to pick up stuff in Wind Waker. It's right on the screen!		But I love him.
That Arnold. He, uhh... sucks at video games.Never understood why he stopped animating 
idk even when he's drawing actual people he still gives them the exact same face.I mean it's a simplistic art style but so are tons of webcomics. Shen's comics are simple but many are really funny. Poorly Drawn Lines is similar. Just to name a few examples. 		I dunno, I follow Adam's Instagram and it's pretty consistently good content, with the amount he puts out. Obviously there's some duds here and there but that's the case for every comic. 
What? He makes bad comics? I've liked all the ones I've seen so far. /r/ComedyCemetery sort by top
What? He makes bad comics? I've liked all the ones I've seen so far. Yeah I don't get the hate for Adam. He's not the best comedian in the world but his comics are pretty funny or at least amusing (or have been in the few months I've been following his content). 		At first I was skeptical because of the Buzzfeed association but then he [posted this](https://instagram.com/p/BMiI6slBQ2p/) on his Instagram and I was sold. 
What? He makes bad comics? I've liked all the ones I've seen so far. Same here. I guess the buzzfeed hate sticks to the guy since he works there.

What? He makes bad comics? I've liked all the ones I've seen so far. A lot of people on Reddit dislike his comics.
But it's not It clearly is a commentary on the surveillance accusations. It's right there that he was bugging Michelle. He probably just likes to see her even when he's not around though.
What does that mean?[deleted]
What does that mean?From what I can gather, Julia Kay is transgender. A deadname is the name a transgender person used before transitioning, and no longer uses.
What does that mean?The artist of the comic in the post I replied to came out as transgender several last July, and goes by Julia now. They've been doing a really good autobiographical comic about their transition and their experiences surrounding it since coming out. As dumb as it might sound, she's a little bit of an inspiration and helped me with my own coming out as trans and accepting and being happier with it.
What does that mean?Going to assume it has something to do with Jeremy Kaye now being Julia Kaye. 
Yes, but it is a part of the Hawaiian culture. "Ohana" is changed to Obama here.Thanks Obama! :)
Yes, but it is a part of the Hawaiian culture. "Ohana" is changed to Obama here.And Obama is a Hawaii guy too!
no obama was the president of the united states sillyCharming use of irony!
He's actually getting back into politics--he's gonna work with the Democratic Party to combat gerrymandering.I understand. But he earned a few months off.
He's actually getting back into politics--he's gonna work with the Democratic Party to combat gerrymandering.A) thank you for letting me know this :) 	B) thanks for knowing about gerrymandering 	C) I hope they succeed and soon. I'd imagine having an ex-president working your side is a good boost to popularity and success rates. Gerrymandering actually screws a lot of states and people on a lot of issues. 
If he is then I am super jealous, I would love to have a beer and a meal with Anthony Bourdain. But also if he is, he sure as hell earned it a lot more than I did. Have you seen the episode where they did meet? It was in Hanoi, Vietnam! It definitely had the pretense of politics, but it's still really cool
[removed]this is /r/wholesomememes		I'm pretty sure it's not the place to talk politics. 		Please don't try to start something. It's not very wholesome. 
[removed]I'm holding myself back from a political debate so much. Must.... stay... wholesome...
[removed]I guess there's a lot I didn't know about Anthony Bourdain.

/r/ComedyCemetery sort by topYou want /r/comedynecromancy, sort by top. He gets fairly often 125% of the joke, just need to cut back slightly.

/r/ComedyCemetery sort by topNone of his comics are on the top page of that subreddit. There are like two on the second and third page. 
/r/ComedyCemetery sort by topI don't the get why those guys in that subreddit hate him so much. Maybe because he works for BuzzFeed? I don't know about you but it's hard as hell to have to crank out comics almost twice a week just to keep a job. Stand up comedians at least get more time to work on their set than that.
/r/ComedyCemetery sort by top[deleted]
Same here. I guess the buzzfeed hate sticks to the guy since he works there. It's because he's really lazy with his art and will copy/paste entire panels multiple times in the same comic, and his punch lines are often weak and smothered in more weak punch lines.
[removed]He's not anymore controversial than any other recent president, in fact less controversial than most.
[removed]Because it's just a dang meme silly 
Charming use of irony!Alanis? 
I understand. But he earned a few months off.In his outgoing interview with NPR, he said something like Michelle deserved a good vacation. I think that's where those pictures of him windsurfing and doing all those other fun things came from.		I'd imagine though that for him, his happiness is tied a lot to his work--you don't run for President if you don't enjoy working hard.
[removed][removed]
[removed]Well, when his successor starts governing I'm sure he'll be more than happy to return to windsurfing ;)
I'm holding myself back from a political debate so much. Must.... stay... wholesome...Hey bud, you're doing a fantastic job. Keep it up, and have an amazing day!

/r/Adam_Fkn_Ellis_Again That sub is tremendously bitter 
/r/Adam_Fkn_Ellis_Again That sub is very unwholesome (and very political for some reason).
None of his comics are on the top page of that subreddit. There are like two on the second and third page. He's definitely a household name around those parts. He might've gotten better recently, or /r/comedycemetery decided to just leave him alone. Who knows.

[removed]Not here man. Elsewhere.
Hey bud, you're doing a fantastic job. Keep it up, and have an amazing day!You are a good and supportive person! Your comment was highly encouraging and is appreciated!
He is though. You just don't hear about it on the news.I don't even watch the news, what's your basis for saying he is controversial?

He seems like a workaholic, please don't work yourself to death, Barack...If I may believe Michelle Obama in her interview with James Gordon, he stopped working the moment he was with his family and didn't talk about work unless asked. So I don't think he is a workaholic.		[Link if you want to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln3wAdRAim4)

Dat don't even make sense yo.  He just nipped a Syria/Russia ground war in the bud and had a very successful weekend with the Chinese President and got invited to a big party in China vs Obama not even getting a staircase rolled out to his plane when he landed there, also his excellent SC pick got confirmed despite democrats doing everything in their power to stop it, so we have a full bench again.		Just a couple of many examples, Trump is governing the fuck outta this country right now.Awww. You're trying to justify so hard, aren't you? I'll let you pretend, it's okay. We're in wholesomememes! Take a joke, chap! ;)

Well who's small O?The wee (or not so wee) babby Obamas I suppose.
