Well everything is better."Yes, yes. This is a fertile land and we will thrive. We will rule over all this land! And we will call it ...This Land!"
Well everything is better.I did something similar to this on my trip to Italy. I brought a little penguin toy and took pictures of him at each of the big landmarks that we saw. Then I left him at my favorite place that I visited so that there will always be a piece of me in Italy.
Well everything is better.Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!
Well everything is better.Can you imagine how big an airplane for a brontosaurus would be?

Well everything is better.But is there a sudden, but inevitable, betrayal?
Well everything is better.This is a fine land. We will thrive here, and we will call it... This Land.
Well everything is better.Everything is better with dinosaurs in much the same way that anything is better in space.		I call it the Firefly effect. Cowboys? Meh. Space cowboys? Oh, yeah!

I'm about to take a trip to a few national parks, and now I definitely need a travel buddy for photos.

Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!Came here for this. Was not disappointed. 
Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!Fun fact, Wash had only taken them along for the trip because he had seen an old Reddit archive about how taking photos at cool places is even cooler with dinosaurs. He found the concept whimsical and promptly bought some of the toys to bring on his journey. Of course, there was little worth photographing where they went, and the constant occurances of terrible events lead him to take solace in the little plastic creatures, giving them full stories and sending them on fun adventures that often were a reflection-perhaps a coping mechanism-of his own adventures. When he... I'm just pulling this all out of my ass why are you still reading it? Go watch Firefly. 
Can you imagine how big an airplane for a brontosaurus would be?It would be very big.
"IT'S THE GREAT VALLEY!!!""Littlefoot. Let your heart guide you.  It whispers, so listen closely."		One of the most engrossing kid's movies I've seen.

This makes me think of a movie idea where a bunch of talking dinosaurs make a park full of humans and all the humans break out and try to kill them.I'd watch it.

I was gonna say something cynical but then I realized what sub I was on and then I stopped because I know everyone here is nice and I should be too. Dude how could you be cynical about someone being happy with their penguin partner
I was gonna say something cynical but then I realized what sub I was on and then I stopped because I know everyone here is nice and I should be too. Nah if you don't feel like it you shouldn't force yourself to be nice and happy. You can say whatever's on your chest, we're here to support :)

Unfortunately that was years ago and I've lost them I'll go digging in my old pictures for the penguins but I might not be able to find them.That's ok! Thanks for putting in the effort of trying to find them :)
I would also love to see the penguin pictures!Here here! 
Dude how could you be cynical about someone being happy with their penguin partnerProbably litter
Nah if you don't feel like it you shouldn't force yourself to be nice and happy. You can say whatever's on your chest, we're here to support :)But I don't want to ruin someone's day to feel better because ultimately I'll be sad and then now two people are sad. But if I'm nice it makes me think of the positives which makes me happier and appreciate everything more. :)
[removed]I think you might have the wrong idea, this is meant to be an unironically positive sub. Some stuff might come off as being ironic or insincere, but I think it's just because we're used to the overall negativity present on most of the rest of Reddit.
[removed]I'm not so convinced! I think it's common to project how we're feeling on other people, moreso online than in other places, and so genuine positivity and happiness and high-fiving-in-text-format can seem like a joke when in fact it's quite genuine.		I think the vast majority of the folks here just want a place where they can give each other a big ol' internet hug, and that's pretty awesome if you think about it.
