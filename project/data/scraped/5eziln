Fun is the name of the game!I like this guy. I was mentored in basketball by a guy named Kendall Webb, and he was the top scoring player on the Wayland Baptist University basketball team. When he noticed that many of the players were beating themselves up over practice, he pulled us aside and told us that if weren't weren't having fun, there was no reason for us to be here. He told us that in the end, it's really just entertainment for both us and the viewers in the stands, and we needed to remember to have fun. That really stuck with me, and that was when I learned to enjoy sports for the fun of it.

Here's to hoping for a big group hug at midfield before the game along with some well-wishingWell... a fight didn't break out. That's pretty damn good for OSU vs Michigan!
Is that real?It was from ESPN Gameday this morning for the heated Ohio State-Michigan rivalry that's been played since 1897! 
Is that real?It is real because it's a wonderful thought to have, and there are many many people who think like that every single day. Maybe one of them is near you now. Give them a hug or tell them what a wonderful person they are.
And also that everyone on the public enjoys the game :)I hope they don't fight a lot in each other's respective team subreddit.
Go sports![bengles over there making the worst calls!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdwchohlMjI&t=66s)

I can't imagine that this sub gets onto the front page often enough to want to block the sticky.We've been hitting r/all once or twice a day actually.		r/wholesomememes/about/traffic		Anyway Idk why that person wants to block poor Noerdy. :-( Noerdy is nice.
Ah the Christmas truce. Truly a noble tradition.Here, you hold this 
omg then <3Further context- this is the last game of the regular season for both teams. In college football, the top 4 ranked teams get to go to a playoff to determine the national champion. These teams are ranked 2 and 3. It is likely that the winner will go to the playoff and the loser will be knocked out of contention. The rivalry is called "The Game", and it is the biggest game of the college football season so far 
[removed]Whoa whoa. You're speaking the truth, but the tone is negative. 		Here at wholesomememes we try to keep things peaceful, fun, and enjoyable!

And if there's one thing about CFB, it's that nothing is a given!
Off-topic, but your username is just beautiful.Thank you, I like to think it expresses my soul 
Whoa whoa. You're speaking the truth, but the tone is negative. 		Here at wholesomememes we try to keep things peaceful, fun, and enjoyable!I don't even think it's exact truth. There are NCAA violations constantly, but think of how many college athletes there are. They're not all superstars, there are only a handful. I don't think the backup left tackle is getting paid under the table. It's just unnecessarily negative on this wholesome sub
B.c. sticky comments are a pretentious waste of space. Id love to see data supporting their use.Cool it champ, try and stay wholesome while in /r/wholesomememes. Anyway here's the data:		/r/science/comments/56h704/posting_rules_in_online_discussions_prevents/?ref=search_posts
