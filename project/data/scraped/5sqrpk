This is one of my favorite uses of this meme :-) Where did this meme start? I've missed it while living under my rock.
I feel like I'm missing the joke here, can someone please explain? Or am I looking too deep into it?He didn't say Simon says
I feel like I'm missing the joke here, can someone please explain? Or am I looking too deep into it?It's the children's game "Simon Says".		One player is Simon, and he gives commands to the other players. If "Simon says" to do something, all other players must do that action. Otherwise, players must not do that action. Not doing an action that "Simon said", or doing an action that Simon didn't say to, results in that player being eliminated from the round.		In the op post, the first line is "Simon says touch your head", and because Simon said to do it, all players must touch their heads, those who don't are "out". The second line, "Now touch your nose", is **not** what Simon said, and any player who does touch their nose is out.		^(cc /u/Count_Cuckenstein)
Simon says enjoy your life and be grateful of your loved onesOK. Did I call my grandmother this week? Better do it!

[removed]You know what's wholesome? Being the change. Create and post some memes, friends! 
This is one of the few things that brought a smile to my face while browsing reddit, thanks OP that was pretty goodSimon says smile.
[removed]In itself it isn't wholesome, but it gave me a nice recollection of the innocence and simplicity of youth, which I really appreciated. Maybe other people felt this way too. 
[removed]To me, wholesomeness is the absence of negativity, not the envangelism of positivity. While the latter has it's place in wholesomeness, the former Is the base of it. Hence, this meme IS wholesome.
[removed]I agree this meme is more dank than wholesome
Where did this meme start? I've missed it while living under my rock.It started in November on Twitter, but wasn't really used the way we use it now (it was more for general slyness) until Jan 23rd when a Twitter user posted that picture with the caption "you can't be broke if you don't check your bank account."		And here we are a couple of weeks later.		Edit: [found the Know Your Meme page](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/roll-safe?full=1)
Where did this meme start? I've missed it while living under my rock.I think it started with something like "you can't be caught cheating if you don't cheat". 
Where did this meme start? I've missed it while living under my rock.It's been going round in England for a while so I can't remember the first one, it's a character called Roll Safe. Go to YouTube and watch 'Roll Safe Fire in the Booth' it's v funny		
Where did this meme start? I've missed it while living under my rock.From [Know Your Meme:](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/roll-safe)		> Roll Safe is an image macro serious featuring a screenshot of actor Kayode Ewumi grinning and pointing to his temple while portraying the character Reece Simpson (a.k.a. Roll Safe) in the web series Hood Documentary. The image is often captioned with various jokes mocking poor decision making and failures in critical thinking.
Where did this meme start? I've missed it while living under my rock.It's from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFm-t58_E_E) specifically. Personally I preferred the videos he made before BBC3 came into the picture
He didn't say Simon says Yeah, i still don't get it.	EDIT: Wow, i got so many upvotes for being an idiot, thanks guys i get it now. :D
I'm confused too. There's a childrens game called "Simon says". In it the leader says "Simon says" followed by a simple instruction (normally to touch one body part or another). If the leader doesn't say "Simon says" before giving an instruction, you are not supposed to follow that instruction. If you follow the instruction you lost the game.		In this meme, he is following the rules of the game.
OK. Did I call my grandmother this week? Better do it!But Simon didn't say.
Simon says smile.:D
In itself it isn't wholesome, but it gave me a nice recollection of the innocence and simplicity of youth, which I really appreciated.

I think it started with something like "you can't be caught cheating if you don't cheat". I saw that one on /r/wholesomebpt but I'm sure I saw the image before that.

 Yeah, i still don't get it.	EDIT: Wow, i got so many upvotes for being an idiot, thanks guys i get it now. :DIt took me a few seconds		Simon said 'touch your head', so he touched his head, then Simon *didn't* say touch your nose so the guy keeps touching his head and smiles at us as if to say 'Eyyyyyyyyyyyy I'm not falling for that one!'
 Yeah, i still don't get it.	EDIT: Wow, i got so many upvotes for being an idiot, thanks guys i get it now. :DIt's a children's game where certain actions have to be conducted, always accompanied by a "Simon says... " prior to the action. If the person doesn't say "Simon says" before the required action but you still do the action, you lose the game. The man on the picture knows the game well and hence, doesn't pick his knows but sticks with the first action 
But Simon didn't say.Simon says call your grandmother
:DNow frown.			<3
I disagree. This joke did not make me feel positive. In fact it was negative to me because the wholesomeness I loved when I subbed is absentWas it absent because of the nature of the post or did you forget your part in feeling the wholesomeness?		All things can be made made wholesome by the right perspective.
Holy shit... This only started in Jan?? It feels like a year.well it has been going all year
I saw that one on /r/wholesomebpt but I'm sure I saw the image before that.I don't know then :/
The guy is like a walking meme. His go at [fire in the booth](https://youtu.be/7yeNXzaqLA4) is probably the strangest thing I've seen in a while.		I just can't tell if it's intentional subversive satire and he is playing a character or if that's just him. I'm not sure which would be funnier either.Roll Safe is a character created by Kayode Ewumi 
It took me a few seconds		Simon said 'touch your head', so he touched his head, then Simon *didn't* say touch your nose so the guy keeps touching his head and smiles at us as if to say 'Eyyyyyyyyyyyy I'm not falling for that one!'First time someone explains a joke to me and I still get to enjoy it

[removed]That's because those were all the memes people were posting at the time. They've gone down, so we've branched out into general wholesomeness.
